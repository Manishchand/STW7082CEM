 Did I catch your eye? I don't blame you if you had to stop and stare, I am quite cute if I do say so myself.  I'm Ziggy and I think you look like a wonderful choice for my forever friend! I don't give my heart away at the drop of a hat, but if you will give me some time and space to settle in and adjust to my new life, we can be buddies. Once I'm comfortable, I love to go on walks, play, and spend time curled up with my best friends. 
Ziggy is shy  until he knows you and feels safe. He was found as a stray so we have no history on him. He is learning to trust, loves being petted and having belly rubs. He will follow you around the yard. He knows sit and is learning to walk on a leash. He is unsure about what toys are for but shows interest in them.
Beautiful colors in his brindle coat. 


Adoption fee $60 (cash or check) includes neuter, rabies and DHPPC vaccination"

The family that surrendered him to the shelter said he was 10 yrs old, but we and our vet think he is younger. Hearts Alive Rescue has him now and we think he is very very special! He lived with other big dogs, cats, and children from babies to teenagers before. His old family filled out a paper and they describe him as smart and enthusiastic. He knows his basic commands: sit, stay, down, and come and he always let them know when he had to go potty outside. His previous family say he hides during storms and fireworks but loves his people so much and is very sweet and loyal. Butch caught a bad cold at the shelter and is being treated, but feeling so much better already. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and has a microchip.

Butch is ready to start his next chapter with his new family. Is it you!!?? please email info@havlv.com for interest"

If youâre a big dog I will follow you, personal space, whatâs that? I have two big foster brothers and Iâm learning the ropes from them and follow them around. Iâve got lots of energy... I love to run around and play. My sister has been with me too and I donât think we know how to sit still. ??

I do like my food bowl separate from others for now.  Bones and treats, yes please! I love giving kisses, I can be a bit strong with them, so fair warning. I like an assertive figure that will tell me NO and shows me Iâm not the boss. I am only 6 mos old afterall!!  I survived the Korean meat trade so I am behind on my puppy training. ?

I really want an active home with another large breed playful pup to be my best friend. ??

I enjoy my crate I go in it pretty easily on my own and I havenât had any accidents.  I will bark if I hear a noise during the night but if itâs nothing I go right back to sleep. Iâm also really great on car rides. 

Some things still make me a little nervous out in the world as things are still a little new to me, but If you show me itâs ok, I relax pretty quick. I know Iâm a good boy and I know I have lots of love in me for whoever I pick to adopt me!!!  So please have lots of love time and energy for me. I deserve a forever home after all I have been through. ????

The good Sam did the right thing and had Animal Control come pick him up so his family would have a chance to find him. She then contacted us, letting us know what a great dog he was, after having spent only 7 hours with this dirty, matted, skinny boy. We wanted to help, so we requested him from the shelter. The day before we were supposed to pick him up, he was reclaimed, only to be returned to the shelter the next day. So we contacted the shelter, letting them know we still wanted to save him. (He had been put on the transfer list for being scared the first time he got to the shelter.) He was definitely confused about what was going on, but didnât hesitate when I opened the back of my car, and he flew in! By the time we got to the vet clinic he was happy, wagging his tail, asking for attention and affection. He is getting all cleaned up and we are getting to know him a little better.

Gizmo is great with other dogs of all sizes.  He likes to sleep on the bed by his foster momâs feet.  He loves cheese and can jump really high!!   For more information on him, please text his foster mom at (702)366-6391.  Heâs chipped, up to date on shots, and neutered.  There is an adoption fee."

I was recently surrendered to A Home 4 Spot after my owner realized she didnât have the skills to handle me. 
After going through a lot of hard work and training to be a service dog, it didnât work out for me. I was heavily drugged, put in a crate, lived in a prong collar and received zero exercise or down time. 
I love people of all sizes. However, due to my energy level, no small kids please. 
The same goes for dogs. I love them all, but Iâve got too much energy for smaller dogs. Iâve also lived with cats. 
I need a German Shepherd experienced owner. My new owners need to follow up with my trainer.  No apartments or condos.

Bio for Mav:

All dressed up and no where to call home-yet!

I am Mav, a female shepherd mix puppy. I look like I am wearing my fancy eyeliner and am told I am a very pretty girl! 
In spite of a rough beginning where my siblings and I were dumped in the desert unweight, I am very trusting and loving. 
I am working on my potty training and love to play just as much as I love to snuggle. 
I hear how smart of a girl I am lots of times a day and just want to be where all the action is.
If you are looking for a bright, playful pup to add to your household, look no further. text 702 239 7986
I am only three months not quite ready to go yet..

to me


Junior is a very loving, caring and friendly dog. He loves cuddling up on the couch or in bed. He loves playing with other dogs and is always the first to run around in circles and get the other dogs to play with him. Junior is potty trained and walks well on a leash. He loves to be active and take walks anytime you want. but isnât afraid to just cuddle up on the couch and sleep and watch tv with you. Junior is a just the perfect dog all around and accepts any and all the attention and love he can get.  text 702 239 7985

I  need to rehome my 7 year old St Bernard/Shepard mix dog. We adopted her from you 7 years ago. She is large and is very loving, however very stubborn and will nip at our friends and jump on them for attention and so we don't know anyone that wants her. She is good with other dogs small and large and is ok with small children however can knock them over easily due to her size so I would say she would be better in a family with older kids. Our two year old can crawl all over her and pull at her hair and she doesn't mind but if she gets in a playful mood she knocks him down which can be scary for some kids.

She needs lots of exercise and attention which she is lacking in our home and with the addition of a new baby it has gotten worse for her. She often has to be locked in a separate part of the house so she doesnt hurt our guests with her jumping and nipping at them and we feel she would be able to enjoy her later years in life in a different home. We are constantly having to tell her to go lay down somewhere because she is just too much around the babies not for being bad just the way she tries to get attention (she leans and pushes on you) ends up knocking them over and hurting them. We have been trying to find her somewhere to go for over a year now with no luck we even posted her on the no kill network back on November 2018 and paid to feature her and no one has been interested."

Drum roll pleaseâ¦.!!
 
I would LOVE to introduce Doug, Dougie, Douglas to the WORLD!!! This little boy is so beautiful, so special and SO ANIMATED he will brighten up your day with just a look!
 
Here is a little about him!
He is an estimated to be about 4 years old, neutered, up to date on shots. He does suffer from dry eye and will need drops 3-4 times a day in both eyes for the rest of his life.
Dougie came from our local shelter and has with double eye ulcers one is almost healed while the other one continues to give us some trouble but is healing. He was newly blind when we started fostering him, so he was very scared of everything and how it was presented to him and honestly is a bit scared of things still.  He does get extremely comfortable with his surroundings quickly.  He loves his toys, LOVES company around him, loves short walks. He does well with other dogs if introduced correctly and finds confidence with other dogs around him. We are working on some anxiety issues and potty training; I believe he was an outside dog his whole life. He does have some skin allergies but what bulldog doesnât! 
 
I cannot express how great this lilâ boy is, he so affectionate, wraps your leg up like a burrito and will not let go! He does little dances around the house and loves you each time he sees you a little bit more.
 
If you are interested in Doug please contact A Home 4 Spot and if you have any additional questions or concerns for me, please let me know!text 702 239 7986

He gets along well with other dogs, large and small, and he rides dreamily in the car! He sits politely and, if offered the opportunity, will put his nose out to get some fresh air! 

He walks well on a leash but sometimes pulls in excitement, particularly if he sees a new dog or person. He sometimes will bark, but with verbal reassurance from his human, he gathers himself and continues politely on the walk.

Completely potty trained, Marvin does not have accidents. When at home with his human, he kindly stands at the front door when he would like to be let out. 

Despite his age of 6 or 7, he still has energy and does enjoy jogging around or playing with his canine friends. 

At home, Marvin loves to cuddle with his human, but he will also curl up at your feet while you read a book or lay on the bath mat while you take a shower. At bedtime, he likes to sleep in bed with you but, if asked, will sleep on his fluffy dog bed right next to you.

Marvin bonds quickly and strongly to kind people. While he will go into a crate, when left alone he will scratch at the crate door and howl. When left alone at home with run of the house, he does bark, whine, and howl, while scratching at the door nearest him. 

His ideal home would have least one person in the house to be with him most of the time. With some time and consistency, he could gain the needed confidence to be home alone, but being able to have the opportunity to work on his separation anxiety only in short bursts over the course of a few weeks would be most appropriate for now. He is the perfect dog in every way for someone who is able to spend the majority of every day for a while with him, while his confidence and trust bloom.

Meet A Home 4 Spot new kid Lafayette. We have learned so far that Lafeyette is...
***A very happy dog who is friendly towards all people but may not care for small children.
***He is non- reactive to other dogs and cats as well so will probably do well with both.
***Lafayette walks great on a leash and is a medium energy, calm, dog.
***He absolutely loves to play in the water and loves food - we were told he may have some              issues with snapping treats out of hands but have not seen this.
Lafayette is an absolute pleasure to be with and will be going to a home where any children are older and mature.  Stay tuned for more information about Lafayette as we get to know him better but so far, he is pretty perfect.

She's about a 2yrs old petite GSD. Very timid at first meeting but will warm up quickly. She gets along well with other dogs too. ??

She can be a little bit of an alpha/dominant girl as with most GSD females. She has no food or treat aggression, loves the outdoors and could use a little leash work. 

She LOVES attention and has no problem giving it in return. She would make a wonderful addition to any family ?????????

Ava is great with other dogs and does well on a leash.  She uses a dog door, or stands by the door to be let out, and has never once had an accident in her foster home.  Ava does best with calm, older children, as little ones scare her.  She enjoys playing with her ball, and she loves being outside when itâs not too hot.  She will bark to defend her yard.  Ava is about 17 pounds.  She rides very nicely in the car and enjoys looking out the window.  She sleeps on her dog bed through the night. Ava loves to be with her people, you can tell because she has a huge smile when you come home!  To meet Ava, please text her foster mom at (702)366-6391.  She is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped.  Her teeth look great.  There is an adoption fee.

Because of being blind it takes her a while to get use to new dogs and is at first very defensive when they run up to her face. 
With that, she would either do best as the only pet, or in a home committed to very slow intros and working closely with our trainer. 

Kiki has been living at our vet and as much as she loves them she needs a home, a very special home, for a very special girl ??

All costs are paid by rescue.

He has been with the same family for for all 5 years but has had some typical behaviors that many beagles have and the family could not handle this anymore. Beagly has some food aggression and resource guarding. which means that typically he might need to be fed separately and you have to be very careful taking things from him that he might not want to give up. He also reacts if you touch him while he is sleeping. Beagly has mostly been able to get away and do what he likes due to the fear of getting bit portrayed to his owners. So far we noticed that he is in great condition and is very smart. He picks up learning rather quickly. Beagly likes to play and is a nice dog. He needs a home that will continue to work with him and have patience. No toddlers though. We have been able to work with his food aggression and he has made great strides. He absolutely loves to watch TV.

adoption fee is $225. Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc.. **Free T-Shirt with adoption, please let us know your size**
For more information or to submit an adoption application, please visit our website at http://www.southernnevadabeaglerescue.com .

Times and locations can be found at http://www.meetup.com/beagles-207/ . Contact us or check our Facebook updates ahead of time if you are interested in meeting a particular dog. All our dogs are in foster homes so not all are available to attend all our park meetups.

His mother was a stray that had a litter of pups.  She and her babies were on their own until Ozzy was about 9 months old and finally trapped by animal control and brought into the shelter. Eventually, Ozzy and his siblings were adopted.  Unfortunately, Ozzy became ill and was returned to the shelter.  It was determined he had valley fever.  For the next 5 months he was in foster care, where with the correct medicine and extra nutrition he started gaining weight and getting better. 

It has been a long road but ge is ready for his own family to love him and for him to love.  

Ozzy will need to continue his medicine daily and have blood work again in October.

This sweet puppy is a huge snuggle bug and wants to be as close to you as possible. She loves playing with toys and is great around other dogs. 

The perfect home for Jolene will give her a job, like agility training, nosework, or something similar to keep her mind engaged and her body working.

If you want to make Jolene part of your family, apply to adopt her at www.onmywayhomerescue.com

Treeing Walkers make nice companions and family dogs, assuming you donât expect them to be content to just lie around on the front porch. They have a strong desire to hunt, and if you donât help them fulfill that need, theyâll go off on their own to see what they can find. On the trail, this is a dog that hustles. Heâll find a track, push it and get to the tree before all the other dogs. Not surprisingly, he does well in coonhunting competitions.

The Treeing Walker generally gets along well with children â although a puppy can be too rambunctious around toddlers â and other dogs. If you have cats, rabbits or other small, furry pets, beware. The TW may view them as prey. Supervise his interactions with them in the home, donât leave them alone together, and donât let them out in the yard together.

Bear in mind that the Treeing Walker is more gung-ho than some other Coonhound breeds. Health permitting, heâll enjoy a couple of long walks or runs daily. Heâll also appreciate the opportunity to run off leash in a safely enclosed area once or twice a week.

As far as training, hounds tend to be independent thinkers who like to do things their own way. They have a short attention span because their interest is always being captured by a scent theyâd like to check out. Assume that if your Walkerâs nose is down, his ears are closed. He is more sensitive, tractable and amenable to training than many hounds, however. For best results, begin training early, keep training sessions short, and use positive reinforcement techniques, never force. The Walker especially appreciates food rewards."

Quick Dachshund Facts
Dachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.
Theyâre known for their short legs and long bodies.
Common nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.
Pronunciation of the word âdachshundâ is DAK-sund and not âdash hound.â
There are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.
Their average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).
Their average life span is 12 to 15 years.
There are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.
They come in many colors and patterns.
They were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.
They have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!
Theyâre considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.
Dachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.
Theyâre stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.
Theyâre not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.
Theyâre brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.
When theyâre puppies especially, theyâll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.
Dachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy youâll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.
Dachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.
When you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.
You should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet."

Thank you for always supporting our rescue mission throughout Southern Nevada.

PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT
Prized as both a companion and guard dog, the Xoloitzcuintli maintains a calm demeanor even as it remains attentive to its surroundings.  It is an intelligent breed, and generally takes to training easily, as long as the training is gentle and consistent. The Xolo will not respond well to harsh training methods.

While the adult Xolo is known for being composed and relaxed, the Xolo puppy, like many young animals, is more high energy and will require more daily exercise and attention â and lots of chew toys. If this is given appropriately and as needed and training is consistent and enforced with affection, the Xolo puppy will grow into an admirable and reliable representative for its breed.

The Xolo does retain some of its more primitive characteristics, chiefly as a hunter of small game, so its environment should be one in which it will not be able to easily escape (e.g., high fences, closed gates).

Humans have long believed that the Xoloâs warm, soft skin radiates healing energy, so as part of its natural evolution has been in alignment with its human companions, the Xolo has developed  a strong sense of tranquility and patience with humans.  The Xolo is believed to relieve the pains associated with rheumatism and head pains, as well as to help relieve insomnia.

CARE
The Xoloitzcuintli needs very little grooming. Generally, a soft, warm cloth to cleanse the skin is sufficient.  Exercise needs are moderate. Daily walks or jogs and outdoor play during warm weather will benefit the Xoloâs health.  Skin care should be undertaken carefully, with regular checks to make sure the skin has not become too dry. Skin care products, lotions, shampoos or anything that has the potential to irritate the skin should be avoided.

With these precautions in mind, keeping your Xolo safe from harsh sunlight, as well as protecting it from cold temperatures will be main concerns. Because they are sensitive to climate, Xolos are considered indoor dogs. They should never be left outdoors for long periods of time. During cold seasons, your Xolo may be more comfortable wearing a sweater, and of course, spending as little time outdoors in the cold as possible.

HEALTH
As a result of its natural evolution, the Xoloitzcuintli is a vigorous and healthy breed, with very few health concerns. As previously mentioned, the skin should be protected from chemicals, sun, and temperate changes. When products are needed, stick to skin care products that are specifically formulated for sensitive skin (like baby sun block, baby lotion, etc.). It is always a good idea to check with your veterinarian before using anything new on your Xoloâs skin."

Jade is a 13 year old Miniature Pincher who was rescued from the local shelter after she was dumped by her previous owners who were having a baby.  Her favorite things to do are cuddle next to her foster parents, hide and sleep under blankets, and go for car rides. 

Jade may be a senior but she has a ton of life left in her and is looking for a home to call her own. She is still spry enough to go to the dog park and go for walks. She recently had her teeth cleaned and her bloodwork shows she needs a kidney friendly diet, which we can supply. She will eventually also need to take kidney medication, which will be covered by the rescue as well. 

Jade is potty trained, her foster home leaves potty pads out when she's going to be gone for extended hours and she uses them. Jade is good with other dogs and doesn't mind sharing her house with a new brother or sister, but also wouldn't mind being your one and only.

This pet is part of our \""Pips Pals\"" Program. 

In March of 2012 we began taking in medically fragile and animals in need of hospice, with our first resident, Pip! However it wasn't until 2019 did we give the program a name and begin to have a focus on those who are so commonly overlooked

Unfortunately, our rescue is adoption-based, and that is how we guarantee that we can continue to save lives. But, we could not let these senior and terminally-ill dogs live out their final days in a cold, lonely shelter. So, we started the Pip's Pals Palliative & Hospice Care. 

This program relies on hospice foster homes to open their hearts to dogs who will never leave. They will not be able to find a wonderful adoptive family, they will not watch their foster dog transform into a healthy pet, they will never say, see you later,but rather goodbye. As you can imagine, it takes a very selfless, compassionate, and strong foster to do this. Essentially, they are taking these dogs in as their own, and loving them fiercely until it is their time to pass.

Say Yes When Others Cannot
Hospice fostering isn't  cheap, Second Chance covers all of our Pip's Pals medical bills. So, we look to donations to help support this program. Each animal gets special food, pain medicine if needed, various other medicine for eye issues, ear issues, dental issues, etc. as well as ongoing medical care to make sure they are comfortable.

When the time comes for them to cross the Rainbow Bridge, we believe in their foster home, surrounded by the people (and animals) they love, is the only way to dignify these sweethearts. 

Below you will find a list of our current hospice animals. We will keep the ones who have passed on our page as well. They are important. They are loved. Thank you for helping us save them.

Iâm a quick learner and have already mastered commands like sit, come, kennel, and shake.  Iâm getting better at walking on a leash and my foster mom says with a little more training, Iâll be a pro in no time.  I am looking for an active family with room to run, as I have lots of energy and love to share.\"" 

From his foster mom:

Jaymie is a 2 year old Springer-Aussie mix.  He is an active and incredibly smart boy who has a very gentle disposition. He likes to play hard, but settles down easy and wants to relax near his human; you get the best of both worlds with this sweet boy.  He'd suit an active person who wants an outgoing and friendly companion - if you can toss a tennis ball or throw a frisbee, you'll have a friend for life.  

Jaymie has been sharing his foster home with two active female pups (a Springer Spaniel and a German Shorthair Pointer).  He has been an absolute gentleman.  He is house trained as well as crated trained.  He will sleep in his crate all night without complaint.  He knows basic commands and has proven himself a quick learner, so he will excel at obedience training.  Jaymie is happy to be by your side, whether you are going for a walk or a car ride or just lounging around.  Jaymie is driven by praise and is learning that tasty treats are an acceptable form of payment for his good behavior.  He is eager to please and enjoys giving kisses.  He will be a great fit with any physically active and fun-loving family.

At the age of 17, her owner passed away and the family dumped her in a shelter. We got her out of there and attended to her foot right away. They were able to drain pus out of the foot and put her on antibiotics. We will continue to watch this. We believe Kami is mostly deaf and she does pretty well for a 17 yr old.
Kami
LOVES snuggle time. Nothing makes this lady happier than your rubbing her belly or your petting her.
Kami
is not shy about communicating to you it is time for snuggles! She has such a sweet personality and is a very social gal - super friendly with kids, other dogs, and all people. She just loves being around everyone.

Kami
is a good loose leash walker and believe it or not, this beagle gal will walk in a straight line instead of zooming from one side to the other. Seriously!

Kami
is a very active girl. She likes many long walks and is a pretty fast walker when she is not smelling.... everything.

Kami
is house trained and communicates when she needs to go outside and sleeps through the night. She is also a funny gal.... If she thinks you are late on meal time, don't worry, you can find her in the kitchen waiting for you.

She enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, just make sure she has extra water around! She should not be in a home with cats but is totally fine with dogs her size. She loves to relax and take naps! She is a snorer! She enjoys laying on dog beds and blankets and listens/understands basic commands. She does not like to be crated; she actually Houdini'd her way out of them but is potty trained.

Hi all,
Milo was born October 6, 2015. He's pretty timid and a stereotypical chihuahua, despite the white coat. He's neutered and up to date on all shots. He's a timid boy and defensive when he's in unfamiliar territory but as soon as he's comfortable, he's incredibly loyal and a sweetheart. He loves toys and looking out the window. He's always excited to see you and hates seeing you leave. He's good with kids that are gentle after he is comfortable in his environment. His ears look like they have chocolate chips on them and he never knows whether to keep them up or down, but often it's both. He's always been spoiled and well taken care of. Text barb 702 338 9562

She has never reacted badly to other dogs that we have seen but she does react to cats.  She LOVES going on walks and walks quite well on a leash without much pulling unless something spooks her, like fireworks.  She definitely spooks easy with fireworks as I think most dogs do.  She just needs to be put in a crate and that helps her feel more secure and comfortable.  She is a pretty quiet dog.  She will always give a few barks when someone knocks or the doorbell rings but she quiets down quickly.  She is very protective of her family.  She has never made an aggressive move toward visitors but she will quietly growl at times until she knows everything is ok.  She is house broken.  I do not know if she will use a dog door as we did not have one big enough for her.  We would just let her out throughout the day.  There are times that she has needed to go and she will \""talk\"" to us and make noises that made it known that she needed something. Our word for relieving herself was just potty.  So we would just tell her to go potty.  The first night she spent with us it took her about 24 to actually go potty until she felt safe and secure. She seems to like going on grass the best.  She is not a very energetic dog as far as playing.  We have tried numerous times playing different kinds of toys and she is pretty uninterested for the most part.  Again, her favorite thing is going on walks. text 702 239 7986

These sweet adults are a bonded pair who were left with only each other after their owner passed away. These girls have been waiting SO SO long and are overlooked every weekend. 

Taking on two dogs may be intimidating but these girls are 8 years old so they are more laid back, they are house trained, and they have basic manners you wonât typically find with a young pup or many former strays. Wheezy (Lab) is the rock in this relationship, she barks to alert you when they both need to potty. And she leads the way for Gracie (staffie) who follows her sisters every move. We canât stress enough how SWEET these pups are. Last weekend one of our volunteers climbed into their kennel with them and was smothered with kisses from shy Gracie. These girls just need a spot on your couch and some head scratches, and you will undoubtedly receive endless love in return.   More will be known about me soon.

My name is Casey and Iâm approximately 5 years old and 100#. I was turned in to the shelter as a stray. I love swimming, playing fetch, car rides and walking with my foster mom. I am non reactive to well balanced large dogs. However, Iâm not a huge fan of small children or strangers. My Foster mom doesnât have any cats or small dogs but said I donât pay attention to them when out walking. Iâm also non reactive to the giant dogs my mom calls horses.
My Foster mom says I donât hear her spoken words and is teaching me hand signals, which is a minor inconvenience.
Iâm available for adoption through A Home 4 Spot Animal Rescue.
If you think you have what it takes to love me and you are familiar with the German Shepherd Dog breed, please contact my Foster Mom Genie for more information. 317-701-6196?

French Bulldogs do not need a lot of exercise, but they do need daily walks to keep them at a healthy weight.
French Bulldogs do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don't overexert themselves.
French Bulldogs can be easy to train, but they can also be stubborn. Be firm and patient when training this breed.
If you value cleanliness the French Bulldog may not be the dog for you, since he is prone to drooling, flatulence and some shedding. He can also be difficult to housetrain.
French Bulldogs can be a quiet breed and are not known as a breed that barks frequently although there are exceptions to every rule.
Because they don't tend to be excessive barkers, French Bulldogs make exceptional apartment dogs.
Although it is important to always supervise young children and dogs when they are together, the French Bulldog does very well with children.
French Bulldogs make wonderful watchdogs, but they can become territorial. They also like being the center of attention, which can lead to behavioral problems if they are overindulged.
French Bulldogs are companion dogs and thrive when they have human contact. They are not a breed that can be left alone for long periods or left outside to live."

In fact, there doesn't seem to be an area on his body that wasn't affected by the agony of having to try to walk on circular nails digging into his flesh.

This doesn't even address the other major problem of his mouth that had been allowed to rot so completely that pus and abscess infection is coming up through his eyes as well as through the skin on his cheek.

His ears were packed with chunks of dirt and debris.

Elliott has a comprehensive treatment plan that has been initiated and we're watching him closely for quality of life but he wants to eat, wags his tail, explores, & enjoys cuddles.

Quick Dachshund Facts
Dachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.
Theyâre known for their short legs and long bodies.
Common nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.
Pronunciation of the word âdachshundâ is DAK-sund and not âdash hound.â
There are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.
Their average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).
Their average life span is 12 to 15 years.
There are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.
They come in many colors and patterns.
They were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.
They have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!
Theyâre considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.
Dachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.
Theyâre stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.
Theyâre not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.
Theyâre brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.
When theyâre puppies especially, theyâll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.
Dachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy youâll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.
Dachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.
When you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.
You should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet."

When excited, he will whistle/whine. He makes some other cute noises in different situations. He is not an obnoxious barker (he has a baritone bark); he may bark if you are outside working in the front yard, but it does not last that long.

The first night here he hopped up on the fosterâs bed, but since then he has preferred to sleep on the floor even over a doggie bed.

He walks well on a leash, but he has playfully lunged at a cyclist, and he acts protective and territorial when there are other dogs on a leash nearby. So attention and firm control with a maximum 6-foot leash is needed.  He does not act this way when at a dog park â heâs very social with new people and dogs.  

Stewy adjusted to a home with two older male Spring Spaniels quite easily. It took him a day or two to be comfortable with a doggie door and now heâs a pro with it. 

Stewy appears to be deaf or very hard of hearing as he does not respond to his name or any other verbal commands, but he is learning some hand signals like waving for him to come.  Many dogs lose their hearing but their sense of smell is even more important. 

Adoption fee- $200

At approximately 2yrs of age, little Star found herself wandering in a strangerâs front yard, far from her home.  Star was then taken to Animal Foundation where her family did not show up to bring her home.   Star is such a happy and beautiful little girl and the stranger wanted to be sure Star would be okay so they reached out to A Home 4 Spot who brought her into rescue.   This friendly girl likes to run and play in the kiddie pool, she enjoys her exercise or walk followed by a nice nap.  Although friendly, Star can get a bit nervous when small children are running around playing and making a lot of noise so a home with older, mature, children is necessary.  As far as other pets, we are still getting to know Star but she does seem possibly receptive towards meeting other dogs.   Please complete an interest application at www. ahome4spot.com  and then text Diana at 702-239-7986 to inquire about Star."

Howdy!  Yep, Iâm missing an eye.  I was found hiding under a car after Iâd been in one heck of a fight (I lost).  Luckily, someone took me to The Ranch where I was able to get medical care.  Iâve healed up pretty well and am now ready for my forever home.  Even with an eye missing, I am extremely good-looking â just look at my markings and my perky ears!  Iâm also friendly and exuberant.  Iâd be a great companion for someone who wants a walking partner.Text for more info 702 239 7986

Ricco aka Lucky needs basic house training and to learn commands. We have been working on potty training, but he is not yet house-broken. He has already learned to âsitâ for meal service, and now willingly goes into his kennel when told âkennelâ. He has been working on âcomeâ and âstayâ, but not quite there yet. He is motivated by treats. Lucky needs a patient family who can teach him all he needs to know about âhouse rulesâ. Lucky does well on a leash and does very well on walks. He is a great jumper, so if you keep any ball-shaped fruit on the counter, he will retrieve it and play ball; until he learns that counters are off-limits! (real-life situation!)

Lucky appears to be a great family dog due to his playful nature and would be a good guard dog due to his loyalty and human resource-guarding instinct.

Lucky is curious about other pets. We have a tortoise and a cat. He will bark at the cat and sniff the tortoise.  I believe Lucky would do well as an only pet. He will defend himself quite vigorously if threatened or attacked by another dog and will not easily give up.  More will be known about me soon.

Shilo is being returned to VSR after 3 years through no fault of her own. After much soul searching, and endless hours of trying to find a different solution, Shiloâs family has decided to do whatâs best for Shilo, instead of thinking only of themselves. Shilo is a beautiful girl, about 5 years old. She bonds very hard to the one person in her family that she decides is hers. Shilo lives with older children and goes to doggy daycare occasionally. Shilo can be an escape artist and has been known to clear a 6 foot fence, so a secure yard, and supervision while outside is a must for this beauty who loves with all her heart. Shilo will need a family with shepherd experience or experience with herding or working dogs. She will need daily mental or physical stimulation to help her be the best she can be.

Quick Dachshund Facts
Dachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.
Theyâre known for their short legs and long bodies.
Common nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.
Pronunciation of the word âdachshundâ is DAK-sund and not âdash hound.â
There are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.
Their average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).
Their average life span is 12 to 15 years.
There are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.
They come in many colors and patterns.
They were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.
They have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!
Theyâre considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.
Dachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.
Theyâre stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.
Theyâre not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.
Theyâre brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.
When theyâre puppies especially, theyâll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.
Dachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy youâll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.
Dachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.
When you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.
You should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet."

She took Mandy with her but then was working two jobs and barely home. Mandy became distraught and anxious and began to bark with anxiety. She decided to surrender her.

We noticed Mandy does get anxious in new environments and it will take time for her to adjust. We found that giving her sedatives and CBD oil helps her cope until she get acquainted with her new surroundings. Then she can come off of these aides.

She will do better with someone who is home more often. She is a sweet easy going 12 yr old female beagle. She gets along with other dogs. She will be a great companion to those willing to help her adjust and make her comfortable.

adoption fee is $100. Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc.. **Free T-Shirt with adoption, please let us know your size**

This mature lady is in need of a warm, safe, and mellow home to spend her senior year's. Tasha is about 15. 2018 was a really hard year for her. Both of her people passed away within 6 months of each other

I cannot imagine how worried she was for them through their illness and how lost she must have felt when they'd gone away. Luckily Tasha found a wonderful temporary foster home for the last few months. They healed her heart, changed her food so her hot spots
went away, and gave her furry siblings and a comfy place to rest and recover. Well, Tasha is feeling so well now that she is making some preferences known. One very important objection is to small children. It's heartbreaking because the kids have really tried to be her friend, but she is not having it. Tasha gets along with other dogs and is tolerant of cats if they leave her alone. She just doesn't want to snuggle with them. We are looking for a child free home to help Tasha be as comfortable as she deserves. She is a senior but has not presented with any health issues.

Yogi is a 9 year old Schnauzer Poodle Mix. Unless heâs changed, we recommend that he be the only dog in the home. Heâs a jumper so he needs a secure yard.

A home with no cats would be best for him. Fine with tortoises :)

Buddy is very insecure and timid and does take time to warm up and does not like to be forced to be affectionate but he is a lover. He likes to sleep on the bed or couch to be close to you and sleeps like no other. Older children are fine if respectful due to him getting nervous with fast movements and is sensitive about his tail being touched. He is very playful with toys and runs fast laps. He absolutely loves going on walks/hikes and does well on leash. He is receptive. He is a low maintenance dog but does have some separation anxiety due to his abandonment fear. No crate for him without a very focus effort to positively train. Right now, he panics if he is placed in a crate or kennel. He loves to be a shadow and he follows from room to room. He likes car rides but is uneasy if he is left along in car and out of sight of his human. For interest, please email info@havlv.com"

One day Spartacus bit the dog and the neighbor reported him saying that she no longer felt safe.  Spartacus has since been in training and lives with a pack of dogs, doing very nicely with his manners.  His mom wants him back, but the stipulations for his return were too restrictive to him and she wants him to have the best life.  She asked us to rescue him from a high-kill shelter and find him his forever home.  He is a dog that bonds very strongly with his human."

He is an very outgoing, friendly guy who loves to go on walks and play. He is housebroken, learning basic obedience, and working on leash training. He'll do best as an only dog 

Blue Boy\"" came to us after being rescued by a good Samaritan who saw him being thrown from a moving car! His ordeal thankfully didn't cause him any long term physical or mental trauma, as he is very loving and trusting of people. He'll make an ideal companion for someone who enjoys a lively dog to take along on walks and hikes. Although energetic, he also enjoys cuddling in a lap and just hanging out with people that care about him.

Sully was one of our Pixar puppies who unfortunately got displaced from his first adoptive home. He was a little too much puppy for that family, but with some more training and consistency he is likely to make someone very lucky. 
Sully can be a lot of puppy for other dogs too, so we would want to introduce any dog(s) you have to make sure they match well before he gets himself into trouble. 
He and his littermates showed off their confidence and smarts a few months ago and Sully already knows the importance of âsitâ â we expect he would be a quick study for other obedience or trick training when tasty treats are involved.

Now that heâs in care and has been seen by vets we have the better assessment that he is still a senior, but more likely 10-13. Butch, however, has some neurological defects and impaired vision that can make him seem older. In spite of those physical setbacks Butch has learned how to cope with two groups of five or more dogs in both his foster home and at our adoption center where he spends most of his days. Butch will often motor around with a funny little wobble, but can see shapes or contrast well enough that he doesnât typically bump into things. 
Our biggest concern for this little guy is that he ate some gravel and had to undergo surgery to have rocks removed from his system that werenât moving either direction. This may be something he tried to do again if unsupervised, so we will be quite particular about the home we ends up in to ensure his health and well-being. 

To find out more about Butch, text or call Julie at 435.773.5209.  His adoption fee is $100 but Butch is also eligible for our Seniors Helping Seniors Program.  If you are 65 years of age or older, ask Julie about it.

This low-rider came to live at That BAM Place while suffering with Cherry Eye (it doesnât look great but is mostly cosmetic) but that is being corrected and after then heâll be ready for his new family. Dom has clearly lived in a home before and has pretty impressive manners â he does get up on our sofa and is still working on the dog door. Though Dom doesnât bay like a hound he has a bit of separation anxiety at the adoption center when he has to be put in his kennel while other dogs are out. This would likely be different in a home environment and we do offer trial placements to make sure our dog is right for you and your home.  Dom does not do well with young children.  
Dom gets along with the wide variety of dogs we have in residence with him, often napping with the smallest 6-pound dog. But Dom wouldnât mind being an only dog either as he seems to have more connection with our staff and volunteers than with the dogs, and prefers to be with people if given the choice. 

To find out more about Dom or arrange a meeting with him, contact Julie at 435.773.5209 by texting or calling.  His adoption fee is $125.

She might look tough but deep down she is just a softy that loves to give kisses and cuddles. She also loves to go on walks and car rides, gets a little sad when you leave her behind. She is very choosy on who her furry house companions are because she likes a lot of love so she does best being the only dog, however she doesnât mind other dogs visiting. Missy is 100% potty trained and would be best with older children because she needs a quiet environment. She is a wonderful dog who will be a great addition to someoneâs family. 
Missy is a gorgeous blue Cane Corso/Pit blend who was very reserved when she first joined BAM but has begun to come out of her shell in foster care. Weâre sure this means that an adoptive home would get to see even more of her personality shine. Missy would love a person or family that she didnât have to share with another dog. However, it may just be that she prefers to be the only girl dog in the home, so if you have a male dog and would like to introduce them we can facilitate that. 

Missy is a medium dog with a lot of muscle, so she would be a good exercise companion and it would help her stay fit too. 
To find out more about Missy text or call Julie at 435.773.5209.  Missy's adoption fee is $125."

This young adult has a lot of life ahead of her and would love to find someone interested in continuing the basic obedience training sheâs learning in foster care (she already knows âsitâ and has mastered puppy dog eyes). 

She is a solid girl, but not too tall, and is as affectionate as she is smiley! Princess enjoys being around her people and will do best in a home without small children. Having another dog as a companion and playmate could be ideal. 

We aren't completely sure what breed blend Princess is but did learn in our adoption center that she's a skilled jumper â though she hasnât displayed the same when around baby gates in her foster home. Given her abilities, a person or family looking for a walking/hiking companion, or with a tall-fenced yard for her to be outside off-leash would be best. Knowledge or experience with strong breeds would be a bonus for Princess. 

??Princess is spayed, microchipped, and vaccinated; her adoption fee is $125. ??

An energetic guy, Daniel enjoys walks and would do best in an active home. Because he can jump fences, he will need a secure enclosure. He would also do best in an adult-only home due to the sensitivity of his hind end and the fact that he has bitten in the past. Daniel can be picky with his doggie friends, but he can live with other respectful dogs. Born in 2017, he came to the Sanctuary from a shelter in Texas. At Dogtown, he is working on crate training and name recognition. In the right household, this sweet and sensitive guy will make a great companion."

Ducky can get very excited and jumpy with people he likes, but he can also get overwhelmed and nervous with petting. Ducky has a history of guarding his food, and he has bitten in the past to protect it. He's made significant improvements with all the training he's done at the Sanctuary, but his new person or family will need to keep working with him.

Although she is still shy and fearful with strangers, she is gaining confidence, and she now loves getting pets, especially under her chin. As she continues to learn and understand that she is safe, she has become a super snuggly, wiggly and silly girl. It is so fun to watch her progress and try new things every day. She will need continued training to get comfortable with people, noises, experiences and handling, but she is doing very well and is interested in learning. Her ideal person will be patient, understanding and willing to work with her. Water is generally calm and a wonderful cuddle bug.

She has some separation anxiety and has previously chewed on door frames when she was alone but could hear people nearby. Mauve came to Best Friends from a shelter in Texas. At Dogtown, she is working on crate training to help manage her separation anxiety. She is also on supplements to help improve her skin and coat. She would do well with a person or family who is home most of the time, so she does not need to be left alone for long periods. Mauve might be your perfect match if you're looking for a dog who'll love to veg out with you. Mauve has a generous sponsor who has covered her adoption fee."

At first, he only wanted to walk if his doggie roommate went with him, but he's been working up to solo walks. While he's on the Dogtown trails, he relaxes as he begins to explore all the different smells, and his caregivers have been trying to encourage him to enjoy these outings. Next, he'll be working on getting more comfortable climbing into vehicles so that, eventually, he can enjoy rides too. Apollo has a good appetite and his favorite 'dessert' is cream cheese. He doesn't mind the snow, and during the winter he would chase after snowballs thrown near him. He's done well with all dogs he's met at the Sanctuary and seems to gain confidence by watching them. He still has a lot of puppy energy and would do best in an active home. Because he's shy and fearful with people, he may try to run away, so Apollo will need an understanding person or family to show him that he is safe.

He does not enjoy a lot of handling, especially by new people. He will accept occasional pets but prefers to just do a happy dance around you. He is also difficult for medical handling. He has become comfortable enough with day-to-day handling that he can be harnessed for walks, and he is working on muzzle training for upcoming vet appointments.

She is always happy and has loved everyone she's met at the Sanctuary. Francine also loves to learn new tricks and training cues. She is very smart and picks up on things quickly. Although she enjoys long hikes and would make a great hiking partner, she is up for anything you want to do, even if it's just hanging out and snuggling or going for a car ride. With other dogs her size or larger, she has great skills, and she would do well in home with them. However, Francine had an incident with a small dog in the past and can't live with them. She also cannot live with cats. Because of her prey drive, she'll need a home with a secure yard, so she can't escape to run after little critters.

At Dogtown he is affectionately called 'Jack Jack.' He adores his toys and treats them like his babies, carrying them around and sleeping with them on his bed. Jacko is playful with new dogs once he has gotten to know them, but he also enjoys sunbathing outside with his roommate at Dogtown. Because of his past, Jacko can be nervous meeting new people, especially if he is meeting them for the first time in a small space. He is more confident meeting people outside in an open space and during a walk. Since walks, treats and toys are some of his favorite things, he will trust new people more quickly if they offer him one of these things. He does take treats nicely, and he is eager to learn new things when treats are the reward. Once he is friends with you, Jacko will run right up to you and stop directly in front of your feet to ask for pets and scratches. He can be a very quiet dog and does not 'talk' very much, unless other dogs are 'talking,' too. He is usually a slow walker, but he loves to run when he feels up to it. Recently, Jacko learned to use a ramp to get into a car. He loves lying down and relaxing in the car and is an excellent passenger. Jacko needs a person or family who will show him that it's OK to trust new people. He'll need extra time to meet new people, especially visitors to a home. When he is comfortable, Jacko is truly a clown. He will play bow at people and flash his adorable smile."

Originally rescued from Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas, Conan went to two other rescue organizations before coming to Best Friends for help with various medical needs. Conan really needed help getting his allergies under control, and with a lot of hard work and structure, he's finally on the upswing. He is very food motivated and ready to learn new tricks or practice nose work, a fun search and scenting sport. He does tend to shred toys and eat them, so hard toys and chews are best for him. He is crate trained, so he is fine with hanging out in a crate when he is unattended or for nap time. Born in 2009, Conan really likes playing with dogs at the Sanctuary!

Nothing makes her happier than when her caregivers sit on the floor with her and give her belly rubs. Despite being a bit too big, she would love to snuggle up on your lap. Coda is also very food motivated. She will guard food and during her assessment at the Sanctuary she guarded high value resources. Born in 2012, Coda is working on losing some weight so that she can get surgery for a torn ligament in her right knee. She is taking prescription medication and doing physical therapy to manage her pain, but she currently needs to be muzzled for medical because of her discomfort. Coda has an independent streak and can be a little opinionated when it comes to decisions about which way to go on her walks. She likes to go for golf cart rides and is happy to let the driver choose the route. Coda is picky with her doggie friends and can be reactive at her gate when certain dogs walk by. Currently, most training is difficult due to her medical issues, as she can't 'sit,' 'down,' etc. on cue. However, she is working on her gate reactivity and appears to be housetrained.

Because of his limited vision, Pudge likes slow introductions, but it doesn't take him long to start to recognize you. Once Pudge gets to know you, he'll get very excited to see you. However, he settles down nicely when he is in a calm environment. During times of high excitement, he gets worked up around other dogs, but is easy to get him to come back when he hears your voice. At the Sanctuary, Pudge has been working on muzzle training and basic training cues. His caregivers are also teaching him to respond by changing direction when he is about to bump into an obstacle. Born in 2010, Pudge is diabetic and gets insulin twice a day. He also takes medication for his thyroid.

Cliff also enjoys very sturdy toys and relishes his \""toy time\"" with volunteers. He has allergies so he eats a prescription diet to control the food allergies and he takes allergy drops to help with the environmental allergies, as well as a few other medications and twice weekly baths.

He gets a lot of his confidence from his doggie friends, so he should go to a home where he'll have a good canine role model. He loves to go on long walks, and would enjoy regular trips to the dog park. When he's extra excited about where he's walking, he'll start \""talking\"" to you about his feelings, which is very endearing. McDreamy was born in 2013 and is so ready to learn and to grow. You can see in his irresistibly soulful brown eyes that he's ready to take the plunge into a real home."

At Dogtown, she has learned that having more dog friends is a good thing, and she does great with introductions to other dogs.

For good reason with her curly tail, mismatched ears and pear shaped body. She a curious girl and although she's shy, she will follow you around for treats and will stick near you. She walks straight up to strangers expecting a treat. The maintenance guy was totally fooled by her. Her and her dog friends love to spend the days wrestling and playing with toys, and she has lived with LOTS of dogs here at the sanctuary. She benefits from hanging out with confident dogs that can put up with her initial sass. Out on the trails Twyla walks perfectly beside you.

He is eager to please and very food motivated, and after some treats and a walk, he is a very friendly guy. Stax walks nicely on a harness and leash and has gone through Canine Good Citizen training in the past. He loves being with his special person and enjoys going for long hikes. He really wants to be an outdoor adventure dog. Stax is not comfortable at big events with lots of people, commotion and noise. While living in his previous home, he had an incident where he was taken to a parade, became overwhelmed and bit someone when they got too close to him. He prefers more private events or off-the-beaten-path adventures. Born in 2016, Stax is a true hound with his nose and sometimes with his voice. He loves to do nose work (a fun search and scenting sport) and agility. He is also learning basic training cues at the Sanctuary. Because he is picky with his doggie friends, Stax lived as an only dog at the Sanctuary for a while. But recently he's been living with a shy female with whom he loves to play and wrestle. Shy dogs are his favorite, because he seems to do best with those who ignore him at first, then want to engage over time. He lived with a cat in a previous home and has passed cat test at Sanctuary, but he will chase outdoor cats and lizards. Stax has had a couple of surgeries at the Sanctuary, and he has some food allergies, but with a new prescription diet, he hasn't had any new issues. He is looking for an adult-only home with at least one active person who would like to take him on adventures."

Lobo can jump fences, so he'll need a home with a secure enclosure and a person who can keep him safe. Lobo has been successful meeting dogs his size on walks and for play dates at the Sanctuary, but he has shown aggression toward small dogs in the past and would do best as the only dog in a home.

At the dog park, she would rather follow the person she's with than to explore the park on her own. Trinity walks great on a leash and rides nicely in the car. She responds well to positive reinforcement and is quite smart. Although she can be slightly nervous when new people enter her space, she does greet people well. Trinity was born in 2014. Due to a history of aggression toward other dogs, she should be a single dog in a home with no other animals, including cats. She already knows basic training cues such as 'sit' and 'down' and is doing training with Dogtown caregivers to reduce her reactivity to other dogs while on walks. She's also working on crate training and muzzle training. Currently, she eats a prescription diet and takes medication for an enlarged heart.

She'd never been given a reason to trust people, and she was willing to bite when frightened. Over time, Skelly has made a lot of progress at the Sanctuary. She trusts her caregivers enough to let them leash her up and take her for walks on the trails, which she enjoys. She is starting to explore new places such as Dogtown's indoor agility area and the offices in Dogtown headquarters, where she can experience a more home-like environment. A good way to build trust with Skelly is through hand-feeding her meals. She is still too nervous to get into a car, but she is working on it. She will sometimes eat her meals near a car, which helps her to see that it's not so scary. She also is working on crate training. Because she is still very nervous during medical handling and grooming, Skelly is trained to wear a muzzle during these appointments. She does allow her trusted people to handle her and examine her as needed. Skelly has play dates with other dogs at the Sanctuary, and she has been easygoing with all the dogs she's met. She's also been a good walking buddy for other dogs. She does tend to be a little sensitive and will squeal sometimes if a dog is too rough, so she should live with dogs who understand that and won't scare her. Although she can be hand-fed by those she trusts, Skelly does guard food bowls from people. She has learned to trade them for other items she wants, like treats. She can also be territorial if she doesn't know a person and will protect her space, including her beds and toys. Skelly is looking for a person or family who will take the time to earn her trust and not rush her. A home with a friendly dog would also help her adjust."

They say he looks like a cute gargoyle. Born in 2011, Stitch came to Best Friends from a rescue organization in California. Although he's had previous heart surgeries, his heart murmur is still a grade five out of six. He takes prescription medication for his heart, and he gets eye drops. Stitch absolutely loves to be around people. He is cuddly, sweet and would make a great couch potato. He can wedge his compact, 60-pound body into his caregivers' laps and snuggle for as long as time allows. He does get overexcited when he's being leashed up, so he is working on being calm and not getting mouthy. He does best in calm, quiet environments and when the person leashing him is calm and follows a routine. Stitch does have a previous bite history. He's also very heat sensitive because of his heart condition and his short muzzle, so it's important that he goes for walks when it's not too hot outside. When it comes to other dogs, Stitch can be defensive when he first meets them, but he usually warms up. He'd do best in a home without cats. Stitch does well riding in a car, although he needs a boost to get in. On hotter days, instead of walks, he likes to ride on the golf cart around Dogtown, feeling the breeze in his face. Stitch is crate trained and eats his meals in a crate. Despite his medical challenges, he is friendly and easygoing with the Best Friends veterinary staff and has been great for medical handling here. If you'd enjoy having a cute little gargoyle who'll curl up with on the couch with you and stroll by your side when it's cool outside, Stitch may be your guy. Stitch has a generous sponsor who will cover a portion of his adoption costs."

Because of a rough past, Alice struggled with meeting new people when she first came to the Sanctuary, but she's made a lot of progress. She warms up to women very easily if they follow a protocol that makes her feel safe. It takes longer for her to warm up to men, but if they are patient and kind Alice will usually start to feel safe over time. Alice is picky with her dog friends. On-leash, she can be reactive to other dogs when they get too close. At Dogtown, she is working on doing parallel walks, meaning that she walks parallel to, but a safe distance from, other dogs to learn how to be calm around them. She would need to meet any dogs before going home with them or be the only dog in her new home. Alice is super food motivated and has also learned to accept trades for her empty food bowl due to some food guarding in her past. She'll work hard to solve food puzzles and enjoys the enrichment.

Now that all his medical conditions are managed, and he's lost weight and feeling is better, he allows people he knows and trusts to pet him a little.

Though he does tire quickly, he's able to stay active doing agility, swimming, going for walks, playing with squeaky toys and wrestling with his doggie friends. He also loves car rides. Born in 2014, Holy Moly has some obsessive-compulsive tendencies. He has a hard time staying focused when he's tired or excited. He has struggled in the past with grabbing his leash and shaking it vigorously while walking. Dogtown trainers and caregivers have been working with him on this and have taught him to hold a toy in his mouth instead. Holy Moly will need to go home with someone who can understand and work with him when he gets tired or frustrated. He has learned impulse control and can usually calm down quickly. He is learning to pay attention and follow many training cues. Holy Moly is an incredibly sweet boy and it's a joy to have him as a companion and friend."

Because Cordelia is a very shy dog, she can be shutdown and extremely nervous when out of her comfort zone. She doesn't like being touched by people and probably never will be comfortable with that. Cordelia would do best in a relaxed, structured home with a very patient person or family who understands her personality and accepts her for who she is. A home without many visitors would be best. When there are visitors, she would be most comfortable staying in a quiet room so she won't be forced to socialize. She'll also need a confident dog buddy who will be a good role model for her."

She also knows how to sit on cue, although she's more comfortable doing that in her room or yard than when she's out and about. Adel can jump in a car and rides very politely, but she prefers to have another dog there with her. This also goes for exploring new places: she will check out the new place but is happier and calmer with another dog there for support. It takes some time to build trust with Adel, but she allows her caregivers to pet her and recently started allowing her caregivers to brush her soft, gorgeous coat.

But with the right doggie friend by his side and a patient person to guide him, he really comes out of his shell. He walks on leash nicely now and loves going for walks with his doggie roommate. He just recently learned that the car is not such a scary thing. He will get in the car and go for short rides, but Dogtown caregivers and trainers are still working on getting him to be more comfortable in the car. When he gets comfortable enough around people, he will show his huge and goofy personality. Wyatt was born in 2014.

Wyatt would also do best in a home with a confident dog who can show him that the world is not so scary. He does seem to prefer female dogs over other males. Because Wyatt can jump fences, he needs a home with a secure yard so he does not try to flee out of fear. Wyatt is already crate trained and is still working on his car skills. He has even been learning to do agility with his roommate. Sailing over agility obstacles he was once afraid of has really helped to boost his confidence. Wyatt has lots of potential.

Who can tell by those ears? Actually, Joy offers the best of both worlds! Her attentive side is eager to please people. She already knows sit, stay, down and come. All she wants in return are love and tummy rubs, which bring us to - her dreamy side! Those belly scratches send her right into a fantasy world. Those eyes are usually laser-focused, but you can just see her zone out under the spell of your touch. Her dreams are filled with wishes for love and belly rubs from a person of her very own. Joy has Babesia, a blood disorder usually picked up from a tick bite. Because it can be transmitted among dogs, Joy must be an only child. But she's ready and willing to give you as much love as an entire pack! Born in 2006, this smart, outgoing gal also loves to run and play. Everyone needs more joy in their life; how about bringing this Joy into yours? Joy has a generous sponsor who will pay for the transportation costs to her new home. This dog is featured as part of our BLISS (Behavior Lifelong In-home Support System) Program. Through this program, you will receive pre- and post-adoption training advice from one of our behavior consultants, as well as a training plan specifically tailored to the dog's transition into your home."

She can be shy with strangers, but once she gets comfortable she loves being petted by everyone. When she sees her friends, her whole body wiggles and her tail doesn't stop wagging. It doesn't take long to get to know her. The best way to win her over is to take her for a car ride. Car rides are Cassandra's favorite thing in the world. She sits in the passenger seat and tries to hold your hand during the whole ride, and she will smother you with kisses. You can also give her some treats, take her for a few walks, and she'll be your friend in no time. If you have treats, she'd also love to show you all the tricks and training cues she knows. Born in 2009, Cassandra is still pretty active. At the Sanctuary, she does well with dogs her own size, but she does not do well with small dogs. Cassandra is a sensitive girl who can be nervous in new places, so she'll need a person or family who will be patient, go slowly with her and show her that new places are not so scary. She'll also need someone who will give her some time to get comfortable and learn the routine in a new home. She loves to go on walks or for a dip in her pool, but she is also content to hang out or take a nap in her crate. She'd also be more than happy to snuggle with you and give you lots of kisses.

Sweet Zuri LOVES her toysâ every time she sees you, she cannot wait to show off her newest toy, and also LOVES hiking-  she does great off-leash. Though she doesnât love ALL other dogs, she is great with any dog off-leash hiking.

She is great with people, but a little skeptical about children- and she likes to dig!
And this is why our Zuri girl has not been adopted. Zuri needs to find a family without younger children or cats, though we do think both of things can be worked on in her new family with the right amount of patience, care, and training.

She just needs someone to give her a chance. And take the time to work with her beautiful imperfections.

DO NOT CONTACT WARF AS WE HAVE NO FURTHER INFO. Sevard Sevi has been in a foster home since November 18, 2018. He is roughly 20 months old, DOB approx 10/10/2017. He was the last remaining pup after the Maddie's Fund event that took place at Pet Network that November weekend. He had been picked up by the Carson City animal control at 9 months. He was on a kill list when Pet Network brought him up to Incline Village. He was in the shelter for 4 months before we opted to foster him. Sevi has learned a lot since moving in with us. He is a much better behaved, and better trained dog since his first day here. I have spent many hours with him, and hired a professional trainer to help as well, and I feel he is much more adoptable after 7 months then he ever would've been if kept at the shelter. He loves human contact, snuggling (in bed-only with my daughter's!!) and he has a great understanding of commands. He loves to play and run around, and enjoys everyone that we welcome into our home. He gets overly excited over children, so only older, respectful kids. He is leash aggressive, so we either take him into remote locations for walks or get his zoomies out running around our large fenced in yard. He loves other dogs, but does not read dog language very well, so proper intro is imperative. Finding him the right play mate is a challenge. Not recommended with cats, as he seems to have a hunting dog instinct. He may be a mix of either Weimaraner or Rhodesian Ridge Back, as well as Pit. He has learned find it games that put his nose to the ground and gets him super focused. More about Sevi: He is very energetic. He is on a lamb/rice formula food, due to chicken allergy and has sensitive skin. He does not like to be tethered to anything, as we learned this in one of his training sessions. Poor Sevi has had a very rough start to his life. Hopefully the right home is out there for someone with dog experience looking for an active, loving companion.

DO NOT CONTACT WARF AS WE HAVE NO FURTHER INFO. I am Sir Lancelot, but they call me Lance. DOB 7/22/2005. I love to play, especially with my rope toy, and man do I love to run. I am a big goofy boy as you can see from my pictures. I am so handsome, and I give the best kisses of all time and will snuggle with you for hours (once I get to know you). If you are on the computer or just sitting down watching TV I will put my head on your lap and wait for attention. They think I am a Brittany spaniel/ golden retriever/ pointer mix. That's a pretty good combination of brains and beauty if I do say so myself. Oh and, personally I don't know what the problem is, but the people say I have to mention this, so here goes. I'm kind of afraid of some things and my initial reaction is, well, to bite. It's just a warning bite. It doesn't usually break the skin, but I guess it can be scary for some people. I immediately regret it but sometimes I just can't help it. Plus, those little people who are very noisy and get all up in my face while getting even louder and sometimes shrill! Yeah. They really scare me! I don't like them very much at all! Um, children, I guess, is what the people call them. So if you don't have any of those, (children), that would work best for me. No children. That's what the people said I had to tell you. So, I did. But the lady I'm with now knows all about it and can tell you all that 'detail' stuff about me when you come out to see me.

DO NOT CONTACT WARF AS WE HAVE NO FURTHER INFO. Liona Liona - Tibetan Mastiff (DNA tested) Approximately 3 yrs old in 2018 Found in field as a puppy. Liona is about 120 pounds of confidence. She is very protective and has no problems putting her mouth on your arm to make sure you know that is not a behavior she is happy with. Even though she has never broken the skin, it is a behavior that can be very unnerving for anyone not familiar with this breed. Then, once a bond is established, she will absolutely protect what she considers hers. Her family, her home, her yard. And she is big enough and intimidating enough to give anyone pause. In new and unfamiliar situations she will watch. She is intelligent enough to figure out most situations. Which, of course, has lead to her being called an escape artist. Being such a loyal and devoted companion, when in a new environment she tends to want to leave and find her way back to her people. Crate doors, no problem. Fence gates, make sure they are locked! It takes her about a month to 'settle in' and stop looking for a way out. Until then it is best if she is not left outside unattended or that any new or unknown individuals try to touch her head. Once you have her trust however, a good scratch behind the ears and a kiss on the nose are expected. Without these, you may end up with a large, heavy and slobbery head being plopped down in your lap. And with intelligence comes the knowledge that she can slip those puppy eyes up at you and have you wrapped around her front paw. Liona is a spayed female, current on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on preventive medication, house trained, crate trained, good with property introduced dogs. She should not be in a home with cats or small children (only due to her size).

Please email Paw Printz directly if you are interested in Luca at: PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com Luca is one of those dogs whose picture you see online and fall so madly in love with him you think you couldn't love him anymore. Then you meet him, and your heart explodes. He is that lovable. Luca is a little shy at first, he has had his heart broken by unworthy people in the past, so patience with him at first is the best way to win his heart. But once he warms up, you get the full Luca experience. He will adore you just as much as you adore him, 70 pounds of total adoration, devotion and kisses. Had a bad day? Luca can help. He can lounge around and watch a movie with you or lift your spirits with a little rousing game of fetch and tag in the backyard with his Kong. He will plop his big fat head in your lap, look up at you with those gorgeous green eyes and you can see how much he loves you and wants to make life better for you. This guy will touch your soul and you will know love. His favorite toy is his Kong. When he is nervous it acts like a binky for him. He is very smart and listen well. He just wants to please and make his person happy. Luca is a Mastiff/Bully mix about 3 or 4 years old (as of 2018). He weighs in around 70 pounds, which is all solid muscle. He is neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, good with properly introduced dogs, but especially good with the ladies. His has beautiful green eyes and a shiny. gorgeous fawn colored coat with white markings. He hasn't had any prior experience with cats so we suggest a home without any feline companions, or maybe a very dog savvy cat. He is house trained, crate trained, good on a leash, knows basic obedience (but can have a bout of 'bully hearing' when sniffing something especially interesting in the yard lol), loves car rides and is an all around good dog. Because of his size, we recommend a home without small children. He can get very exuberant in his play and may accidentally knock small children down. We want both Luca and his new family to be happy so a home experienced with bully breeds is a must. Adoption Process: Application, Interview, Homecheck Adoption Fee: $250"

He does get slightly anxious/ shows signs of separation anxiety (just whines for a few seconds if you aren't paying attention to him but then stops and lays down or carries on). He also did attempt to dig under our side gate into the front yard, but our front yard is gated as well so he wouldn't have gotten anywhere, but maybe just an another anxious sign. He is really spry in his older age, as he plays with our other pup in the video attached. He likes playing around but also enjoys laying and napping on the couch next to you, he has even snuggled with us on our laps a couple times. His owner will pay for his care as he can, but just wants Joey safe. He is great with kids and dogs but not so good with cats.

DO NOT CONTACT WARF AS WE HAVE NO FURTHER INFO. Scout is a 16 month old, 49 lb., mostly Australian Cattle Dog with a bit of Aussie Shepherd mixed in. He loves to play ball, and hang with his people. When Scout is familiar with someone, and knows they are friends, he adores them and will celebrate their arrival with a a happy puppy greeting. However, he is very fearful around people he doesn't know. He would thrive in a quiet, adult-only home, as a companion for a person or couple, who live in the country and rarely have visitors. Scout is great when meeting other dogs and loves to play with them, but when in the same home, he can be competitive with other dogs, and he would be best as an only dog. In a calm situation, Scout is a very playful, relaxed and happy. He is sweet and loving with people he knows. He likes to be in the same room with his person/people, but doesn't need to be underfoot. At home, he is a very quiet and will rest in his bed or beside you. He also sometimes like to snuggle, and will sit or lie down with his back touching you, sometimes deciding to groom your hand or leg. Although he is still just a pup, Scout is a fairly moderate energy dog. He is satisfied with a few daily sessions of fetching the ball and a good walk. He does NOT need tons of exercise. He is a very alert, observant, highly intelligent dog, who learns new things quickly. He has excellent eye contact and checks in with you frequently. Scout has taken basic obedience training and knows the commands Sit, Down, Wait, and Shake. He walks very nicely on leash and loves walking out on trails. He is also completely housebroken and rides quietly in the backseat of a car. We do not recommend him around cats or chickens, as he wants to chase. We also believe that he was traumatized and terrified as a very small pup, and has some PTSD. Fast movements or unexpected noises make him extremely nervous and panicky. All training with Scout must be rewards based, positive reinforcement. Negative corrections or punishment based training methods will NOT work with him, and will achieve the opposite of what you want. He has a deep seated fear of strangers. if a person the the street looks at him or reaches out to pet him, Scout will shrink away in fear. At home, if strange vehicles and people approach the house, he will bark and howl in alarm. If unknown people enter the house, he will bark, growl and lunge at them. He is especially wary of children, and would not do well around them. If he is properly and positively introduced (with treats) to new people away from his territory, he will be fine if everyone walks back to the house and enters together. Strangers must ignore him, but drop tasty treats to show him that they are not a threat to him. With other dogs only (NOT with people), Scout is a resource guarder. He will chase other dogs away from his people, food and toys. If another dog stands up to him, as a parent would to a naughty pup, Scout will respect that dog. Otherwise, in his home, he is territorial with easy going dogs, if they are near his people or resources. His respect for another dog is on an individual, case by case basis and as he gets to know the dog over time. He is completely fine and respectful with people around his resources (food, toys, etc.). Scout requires a quiet home in the country. His nightmare scenario would be a busy urban area, on streets bustling with people and fast moving vehicles whizzing past just a few feet away. If he cannot hide, he will tremble with fear, and will attempt to chase fast moving cars. If a situation proves too much for Scout, and you stop/hold him back from lunging out at the cause of his stress, in his panic he will redirect onto a pant leg, pulling and ripping the material. We believe that his adrenaline and cortisol levels shoot up quickly, and depending on the amount of stress he has experienced, it can take him a full 24 hours or more to recover from the terror and trauma. When he feels safe and secure at home and with his people, Scout is a great companion. He is happy, playful, loving and cuddly. He needs very experienced, patient, loving people with a quiet, calm situation, and who have the willingness and understanding to work with a pup with PTSD. Scout would be best as only dog. No young kids, cats or livestock. Needs an experienced, adult home only.

Cat friendly!

This beautiful young lady was found wandering the mean streets in Oakland California on a beautiful but hot day in mid-July.

Frantic outreach to locate the owner failed, no collar, no chip, nothing. Fliers were posted, messages out on Facebook etc did not find this girls family. 

Was she dumped because she had a hernia that needed repair, dumped because they could not afford surgery? Who knows, but we were delighted to be able to help this little girl out.

During Maddies brief stay in Oakland she was given love and good food, even making friends with the kind ladyâs cat! She loves cats.

She is full of energy, loves to play with others, runs like the wind, barks rarely, sleeps all cuddled up in a bed by herself right now, but she really wants to get into the big bed. She is good on a leash, but needs a little more time to be confident.
Maddie just had her staples out from the hernia repair and spaying, all vaccines are now current, and she is looking to find a new home with at least one other dachshund in it.

Maddie does not like the crate, but she is quite reliable in the house.

If you have a place in your heart for Maddie, please contact foster mom Dawn at dawnaa@pacbell.net

An application and home check are required.

Adoption donation for Maddie is $400.00

Housebroken, leash trained, and always ready to play, Thena would be a great addition to an active family.All of our dogs are available for a $200 donation. This includes them being spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and fully vaccinated.
To adopt a dog, we require an approved pre-application, as well as a securely fenced yard. This means an actual, physical, fence. 'Invisible' fences are not acceptable, sorry. If you live in an apartment and do not have a yard, we are not able to adopt to you.
Please contact us at: dogtownmutts@gmail.com for details.
Please note: we typically do not do 'out of the area' adoptions. This would be any location more than 60 miles away from the Reno/Carson City area."

He likely has some Heeler or a similar breed in him. Hes a large athletic guy who would be perfect for an active family. He thinks every person he meets is his friend, although he tends to be a more independent dog rather than a Velcro dog. He will ask for some love and then move on to his own activity. He loves toys, treats and booty scratches.

Theo is currently in board and train at Evolved K9 Training where he is learning some great manners. Just some of the training he will come with includes crate training, here, sit, down, place, stay and walking nicely on the leash. He will come with 3 free training classes for his new family, and our contract will state a requirement to attend those classes with Theo. This is a pretty sweet deal to get free training and he does need it.

Theo is fine with respectful children, he would do best in a home with older children as he doesnt realize his own size. He is good with other playful and friendly dogs, hes a no for cats and extremely small dogs. He is neutered, vaccinated and chipped. He will be ready to go home in approx 2 weeks (after training).Our dogs are spayed/neutered and utd on shots before adoption unless medically not advised by our Vet."

We are listing him to help with his rehoming as a courtesy to his current owners.

If you are interested in finding out more about him, please contact the person listed at the end of the following set of notes (provided by his owner, Kenny):

His name is Yeti and his information is below:

1. He is 5 and his birthday is in November. He weighs about 65lbs.
2. He is Neutered. When I brought him back from South Korea, the Korean government required him to be neutered in Order to export him.
3. He is up to date on vaccinations as of May of this year.
4. He is not treated monthly for anything, as none of those are currently in my area and there are no signs of anything.
5. No known issues. Last Vet check was beginning of 2018 when I moved from Vegas to northern Reno.
6. He behaves normally around all. He doesnât like to be âtrapped/blockedâ in. I currently have him around my 2 other dogs whom my ex wife is taking. He is also around other animals from my ex wifeâs mom.
7. Normal routine consists of pretty much outside all day. I live on 40 acres and he runs around it all. He exercises outside all day with the other dogs. He only eats once a day, and it is currently at night around 2000 hours.
8. He is both an inside and outside dog. Does great with both.
9. He knows sit, down, come. He pulls slightly on a leash, but nothing over the top. When he sees other dogs, he is just curious. Wants to smell and normal stuff dogs do.
10. He likes to be pet and loved. The only sensitive part is his tail. When we found him in Korea, he had a rubber band around his tail. The doctors had to cut it to make it healthy. That is the only part about him that is sensitive. You can see it in the photos.
11. He rides in cars fine. Back of trucks too. He hates the vet. Doesnât like to get shots, but it is possible. Can be lifted. Just marks his territory a lot.
12. He has not bitten anybody or any other animals that I am aware of. I just came back from overseas after a year, and my ex wife didnât say anything.
13. No separation anxiety or behavioral issues that I know of. He is kennel trained and dog door trained.
14. I adopted Yeti while I was stationed in Korea. I rescued him from a meat market. He has had all American veterinary care in Korea and well as in the states. Up to date on all shots. The reason Iâm rehoming him is because I got divorced right before my deployment and now that I am back, with the divorce and child support, I can no longer keep a place that can an animal can accompany me. I have to downsize my current lifestyle and living expenses in order to keep my head above water. I have had Yeti since 2014 when he turned 1.
15. I have not contacted any other rescues as of this moment.
16. Best method of contact is 702.823.9275 or kenny032004@gmail.com

***************Sydney was born deaf***************************

Sydney is a typical Boston Terrier - if you don 't know what that means, please research Bostons. They are high-energy, high intelligence, stubborn, and the best personalities you will ever encounter, but they ARE personalities.

Sydney was born deaf and has NO volume control. She is a dominant female and has marked (although current foster says she has no issues with this or general house-training). She is crate trained and we are working on obedience training.

Sydney is a wonderful dog - but Boston Terriers aren't for everyone. If you're familiar with the breed or ready to tackle a challenge, please put in an application today!

Her foster family says she is PURE LOVE! She is currently in a foster home with 3 other dogs, 2 cats, and 2 humans. She is blossoming in this environment and so full of energy and love. She enjoys playing with dogs and takes correction from them well. She does well with cats, too. She is super affectionate and wants to follow you everywhere. Brandy likes to go for car rides and settles down quickly. Brandy is shy at first when meeting new people. She has struggled with fear of strangers for a long time and needs consistency and patience from her forever family. Once she gets to know you she will cuddle up and be your best friend! Brandy would do best in a home with other playful dogs and no small children. She may excel at agility training and is very treat oriented. Brandy is waiting patiently for her forever family, could it be you? Give us a call to meet this special girl."

Katieâs got your back (or more likely, your lap)! 

Do you know what you get when you adopt a senior dog? You get a family member that knows the rules already and appreciates life and the love you give them. All theyâre really looking for is a soft place to sleep and a gentle hand, their exercise needs are minimal but the love they still have left to give is at its maximum during senior years.

Our sweet little Katie loves people, sheâs ready with the kisses and is quite affectionate. She lived with one family her whole life until circumstances changed and she found herself homeless. She settled into the Pawsibilities routine quickly and bounced right back, eager to love and be loved. 

Katie (Lady Katherine of the Valley)
Chihuahua Mix, Spayed Female about 7 years young
Katie would prefer a home with other small dogs or being an only dog (she knows sheâs a princess and wouldnât mind being your only dog to spoil). She seems to really like cats!

She appreciates when people take their time and are gentle with initial meetings, after that though, youâll have yourself a velcro dog! She walks fantastic on a leash and literally just wants to be your shadow.

Kylo was brought to us as a result of a hoarding case. He hasn't had many experiences and will be required to take classes with our professional dog trainers to work on his confidence and help him become the dog he is meant to be. 

Kylo is a loving and happy dog. He likes to play and is working on housebreaking. He IS A 100 POUND PUPPY - so he has puppy behaviors like chewing and needs a family willing to help him learn. 

Kylo has a severe leg injury and we will be providing more information soon.

Due to his age and breed, he will be placed with a neuter contract and future appointment scheduled for when he is a year old. At that time, you're able to include stomach tacking at a discounted rate if you would like that piece of mind. We will be requiring a $300 deposit that will be refunded once he is neutered.

She is a very aloof girl and very particular about her people. She has a gentle personality, loving and affectionate but overly reserved or shy with strangers and will run and hide.  However if she trusts you, she will jump on the couch for loving, and loves being a lazy house dog.  She does not like neighbor walks, children, and loud noises. Her perfect home would be a person who does not mind a shy but well mannered, housebroken quirky girl.

Lydia is about 6yrs old and about 15lbs and gets along with all dogs but is not a dog playing dog and will do just fine in a house with cats. She is healthy and received a dental. She is spayed, up to date on her vaccines and ready to go with someone who does not mind a dog that hides. 

BUT... WHAT IS LYDIA.. REALLY LIKE?  Safe Haven Lydia. A mellow no bother dog. Scared of strangers except for dogs. Really scared of kids and blonds. Sleeps most of the day and gets her wiggle on around 8pm. Enjoys her evening 'barking at nothing' time. And afterwards jumps on my lap on the couch with poop breath. She sleeps soundly and snores right next to me in bed. She is fully housebroken but will pee inside the house a few times a year just because she can. Loves getting attention when she wants it. Jumps into the car and extremely nervous when it moves. Absolutely LOVES her off leash desert runs and asks to go out for a run anytime of day. Loves treats but refuses to sit or learn anything to 'work for it'. She is a bone hoarder and they can be found in her hiding spots. You will also find little bits of poop there too.

Lydia is available for a new home but does a drama queen nervous display when she is reviewed by people interested in her. She has made the decision she doesn't want to leave Safe Haven but she deserves a home of her own.

Anyone interested in her? It will take a year or two before she stops hiding from you, but once she loves you she loves you. (as long as you are not blond 'cause she will just bark at you) Sigh....

For more information use the on-line application at www.safehavenkennel.com or learn more about her by calling 775-463-1842 or email barkdogsinfo@gmail.com. The fee to adopt is $100 Safe Haven Rescue Kennel 28 Highway 95A North, Yerington, NV 894470"

When she arrived, she was very ill and our vet diagnosed her with Addison's disease. It is now very well-controlled with medication and she is able to live a normal, active life.
Bell-A is only going to be available to a home where she will not have contact with children under 16. We are serious about this, so that means no visiting grandkids, no neighbor kids poking fingers through the fence - no kids, period.
She is an amazingly affectionate, smart, athletic girl. In an adult home, she will be the light of your life. We all love her and are going to make sure she goes to a home that is capable of keeping her safe and healthy. Her monthly injections at the vet run about 125.00 and she will need these every month for the rest of her life.
All of our dogs are available for a $200 donation. This includes them being spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and fully vaccinated.
To adopt a dog, we require an approved pre-application, as well as a securely fenced yard. This means an actual, physical, fence. 'Invisible' fences are not acceptable, sorry. If you live in an apartment and do not have a yard, we are not able to adopt to you.
Please contact us at: dogtownmutts@gmail.com for details.
Please note: we typically do not do 'out of the area' adoptions. This would be any location more than 60 miles away from the Reno/Carson City area."

He has loosened up and is now ready to transition to his forever home. He takes some time to build trust with people, but once he does, he wraps his four paws around you like he'll forever be yours! He is extremely affectionate with those he knows and loves to play with younger dogs and dog friendly dogs. He is on a special training program here at the center and with calm leadership, he absolutely thrives and learns and loves! We invite you down to meet his trainers and learn how we've exposed him to life! His new adopter will need to carry it forward on so that Mac can continue to gain exposure and positive experiences! He is trying really hard not to chase the lizards and small critters, but we do believe there is some terrier in there telling him to \""catch\"" \""catch\"" \""catch\""!

Her past is that of survival and disconnectedness. After many months in our program, Willow has asked us to help her find something very specific in her forever home and we are working hard to find it! She connects to dogs first and foremost.

It will take time for her next \""family\"" to build a relationship with her while she stays at CRCS, then it will take time to transition her home.

All dogs in the program spent time in our local county shelter, surrendered by their owners or picked up as strays and waiting for their owners to redeem them or to be adopted by new families.   The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.

The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.  To meet any of the Pups On Parole dogs, arrangements must be made in advance."

Abbey is the 2 year sister of Lulu (who is also listed on this Petfinder site for Lassen Humane Society Pups on Parole dogs).  (Abbey and Lulu get along great, and you can adopt them BOTH if you're looking for double trouble and twice the love and devotion.)  Abbey is curious little thing!  She snoops around, exploring her new world and alerts at all the new sounds of a Fire House. So far she does well with her crate and kennel. She will get introduced to the cat tonight :-) but is still warming up to the bigger dogs. Poor little Abbey is shell-shocked from her last week of scary changes in her life. She needs to find her FOREVER home!  Only one more move (to the home of her permanent humans) is in her future!

His handler said he would consider Sunny to be a gentle, low energy dog EXCEPT when opportunities for play come up; then his puppy playfulness comes out!  He does well in his crate and kennel and  is still finding his grounding, is still a little apprehensive of large groups of people, but we are confident that once he settles in and gets to know everybody that will disappear. He's good off leash and sticks with his handler. Sunny is still learning how to walk on leash politely but we certainly will get there.

		Modric is a stunning, dark sable, adult male who is on the smaller side weighing about 60 lbs. He was surrendered when his owner could no longer care for him. We believe he sired both Luis and Clark, two other boys that made their way to us.  It is our understanding that Modric was an outside only dog, but he has quickly discovered there is no better place than inside with his people. He loves to settle in on a nice soft bed, preferably near his human, when hanging out inside. He prefers to be wherever the people are inside, but watch out for your shoes; after spending most of his life outside he hasn't quite learned that shoes aren't for chewing. 
 
		Modric is housebroken with the use of a doggie door. He easily settles into a crate and is happy to sleep quietly for the night in a crate next to his foster mom's bed.  This boy is quickly learning basic commands such as sit, down, bed, and wait at meal time. When Modric is excited, especially when coming out of a crate or kennel, he can get a little jumpy. If you are patient and don't let him call the shots, he will remember his manners and will eventually settle and finally sit on command in order to get in/out. He walks well on a leash and does not have a tendency to pull or be dragged. He is fairly submissive, so a light correction will often help him follow any request or command as he is eager to please.
 
		Modric loves to meet other dogs and gets excited any time he has a chance to meet new friends. He is a very thorough sniffer on first encounter but quickly settles in after meeting them and exploring their scent. He met the other GSD's in his foster home easily and fits in well with his foster pack.  He is now starting to engage & play with the young, playful pack-mate and watching him play makes him appear much younger than his estimated 5 years!  He appears to be just as happy to be near and meet small dogs, but has not spent any real time with smaller dogs yet.. He is VERY interested in watching the outdoor cats from his fenced front yard, and he tends to lose all desire to follow commands or come when called when he focuses on them.   It is uncertain if he can be taught to live with cats or furry critters.

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service.

		Dean is a handsome black and tan boy at around 18-24 months old. He came to us from a local shelter so we don't know much about his background. This stunning boy is young and active and loves to get attention from dogs and people alike. He really believes he is just a giant lap dog and would love nothing more than to snuggle up and get attention from any willing person. He will try and climb/put his feet up to get closer to his person but quickly gets back down when corrected. 

		Dean currently lives with another female shepherd and loves to follow along. Often times when she heads outside to chase the squirrels or just watch the world outside he has trouble deciding whether to stay with foster mom or follow her outside. He can be a bit insistent and pesty when he wants attention, but takes correction well from both humans and other dogs. He does not have a loud bark, but he uses it well and often when excited and ready to engage others in play. 

		Dean is housebroken with the use of a doggie door and has no problem letting you know if he needs to go out. He is learning his basic commands and is learning not to pull on the leash when going out for a walk.  Dean does not like to go into a crate, but once he is in, he quickly settles in and sleeps through the night with no issues. He has not been around small dogs or cats so it is unknown how he would do. 

		With continued training and socialization, this young boy will make a nice addition to a family that is willing to make him a part of their lives.

He has a handsome tan coat and  a black muzzle.  He weighs 59#, which is a nice medium size for a Shepherd.   He has a great athletic physique and weight which can be maintained with medium level activity.  Flash is a such a polite, mannerly, great dog that his new owner or family does not need dog owning experience to successfully handle Flash.

Flash starts out a tad shy, but quickly warms up to his usual outgoing, confident, excitable self - pretty much what you would expect from a teenager!!.  He does calm down quickly.   The volunteers and staff are working on his leash training.  We found out that he loves the water.

Flash likes to be petted on his head and back.  He needs to be around more people to reveal more of his personality.  We think he spent too much time alone and away from loved ones.

He is a nice, handsome, healthy dog ready for a new home with people who will love him unconditionally and want to spend time with him and make him a part of the family.

Flash is okay with dogs and cats after proper introductions.  Flash appears to be scared of cats.  Flash will need a secure fence for a play yard.

Flash is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Flash can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center 
11232 B Avenue, Auburn, CA 95603

He has a handsome combination of markings including a white chest blaze and white socks.
Roscoe has great physique and carriage plus is at a good weight of 74#.

Roscoe is a playful lad with plenty of energy.  He will need medium to high activity everyday - making him a perfect companion to keep you and your family fit and trim.  Roscoe is outgoing, confident and assertive.  His personality is perfectly complimented by a sensitive, independent and affectionate side.

Roscoe is very smart and observant.  He knows how to sit and stay down.  Roscoe is receptive and sensitive to correction making him perfect for a previous dog owner who wants to continue his manners and skills training.

Roscoe is okay with cats and dogs with proper introductions.   When in a playgroup with other dogs, he showed he was pretty rough and rowdy so it would best that if there is another dog in the home that they be submissive.  As always, dogs should be fed separately.

Roscoe loves to be touched, held and petted.   He is attentive to people.  Roscoe loved to play with toys, as if he had  never seen a toy before in his life. He canât get enough! Itâs so cute!

Roscoe is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.

My name is Nemo

How old are you? I am 10 weeks old! Born approx. July 25, 2019

How much do you weigh? I weigh about 15 lbs!

What do you look like? I have a beautiful brindle coat with spots down my front right leg & on my belly.

What do you like to eat? Is everything an acceptable answer? I eat my kibble for breakfast and dinner, then allll the treats during the day!

What kind of personality do you have? Im a spunky little guy, full of energy! But also an amazing snuggler!

Describe your perfect day: Wake up, go potty, scarf down breakfast, chew on alllll my toys, play âfollow the leaderâ with my foster bro, poop, nap so hard with my foster mom, inhale dinner, potty some more, sleep all night, then do it all over again the next day!

What is your favorite toy? I can make a toy out of anything! But rope toys or chew bones are my fave because they donât fall apart so easy & I can play tug-a-war with them!

Do you know any tricks? I am very good at âsitâ especially before getting my food or waiting for a treat. I am slowly learning âdownâ. Not a fan of ânoâ but I have chosen to accept it!

What scares you? Nothing yet! My foster mom has introduced me to a lot! I love the robo vacuum, and I can tolerate the garbage disposal, blender, regular vacuum, hair dryer, and motorcycle! Slow, positive intros set me up to be fearless!

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I have not but with the right introductions and some set boundaries, I definitely could!

Do you like cats? I have never came across one but my foster mom thinks I would do just fine with them especially since I am still young.

How do you feel about other dogs? I LOVE OTHER DOGS! I have been around them since birth & couldnât imagine life without them around!

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? Outside, for sure! Or taking a nap on the couch. Both are great options!

How is your health? Iâm as healthy as they come!

Who do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion? I live with my foster mom, foster dad, and big foster fur bro Boris! Mom is definitely my bestie! She just loves taking care of me & my fur bro. No like really, she does! Always feeding us & picking up all our poop! Thatâs love!

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
I like to hang in my crate with a few toys & a comfy bed! I have only had one accident in there so far too!

Where do you sleep? I also sleep in my crate all night! Naps are taken on the couch though, duh.

Do you like walking on a leash?
The leash is more of a toy to me right now since I canât go on walks yet but I know I could learn with a little guidance & a great role model!

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?
No digging, little barking/whining - only a teensy bit before bedtime or if i feel the need to get your attention to take me out to potty, but lots of chewing/eating things so you have to keep a close eye out!

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) I do! I rarely have any accidents in the house because my foster mom knows my cues & pays very close attention!

Do you like water? To drink? Absolutely. To play in? Still to be determined!

What do you love about your foster family?
I love how much they love me! Everything they do is for my own good or safety! I may not like being told ânoâ or âleave itâ but I know its for good reason! Also, I couldnât have asked for a better foster fur bro! I know I can be a lot for him at times but he puts up with me & I know deep down heâll miss me!

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? Well, I have only been with NorCal!! They took my mama in when she had me in her belly!

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Nemo's adoption donation is $350.

Interested in meeting Nemo or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

Remi is up to date on his shots, is neutered and microchipped. The adoption fee is $4000. We adopt in El Dorado County/surrounding counties. Unfortunately, we DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF STATE EXCEPT FOR RENO (also surrounding areas to Reno within 30 minutes).

The rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs.

She's taking a little more time with my husband but now, less than a week later, he can pet her and she'll come to him very cautiously when called. She is so smart and happy and eager to learn. I'm pretty sure she was potty trained before so our \""housebreaking\"" was more of a potty training refresher course. She loves her crate and would sit in it all day waiting for treats if she could. We're working on duration of crating and people being out of sight when crated. She sleeps in a crate next to the bed just fine. I don't hear a peep out of her all night.\"

He has to have a job or he'll get into too much trouble. 

Cooper is great with any dog of any size. Loves kids but if they are too boisterous, he'll go get in a kennel until they settle down. He loves to cuddle and sit on your lap. He's clicker trained and very eager to learn. He loves going to training classes and is a very fast learner. Cooper is both toy and food oriented. 

He came to Rescue and had not been groomed in 6 months or more. He was a matted mess. He hated being brushed most likely because he was matted close to the skin and bushing pulled at those mats. He will allow someone he trusts to groom him and gets better with every grooming. He still isn't excited about having a nail trim but will get there. He'd be best if his owner did the grooming instead of using a service. Otherwise it will take a bit for him to trust his groomer. Once he does, he's fine. 

If you are looking for your next competition agility dog; this is your boy. Cooper lives with large and small dogs. He's eager to please, loves to rid in the car and is ready to learn. He is available to a performance sport home only...agility, dock diving, competitive obedience or rally, etc. His AKC papers are available.

		Spark is a beautiful two year old, all white female long coat weighing about 65 lbs. She was surrendered to a shelter along with her sister Havana and possible sire Judah when the original owner lost his home. The previous owner indicated Spark had been an outdoor only dog. It is obvious that Spark has had at least one litter of puppies in the past.

		This is one sweet girl who walks well on a leash and craves human attention. She appears housebroken as long as she's not left alone inside without human companionship or a means to get outside for long periods of time.  She is learning house manners and the sit command.  Spark is not food motivated, so praise and affection work best in teaching her new things. She gets along well with the other dogs in the foster home that range from small to large in size.  She has shown signs of separation anxiety by pacing, scratching at windows, and any window coverings in the way.  She doesn't like being out alone and will bolt out the open gate or try to find an escape if given a chance.   Having other dog companions and a dog door for her to go in or out may be the best option for this girl. 

		Spark can be a little timid with new people.  Continued socialization, exercise and training will make Spark into the best companion dog.

This dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.

For more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. 

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State.

Elvira is a four year old female Pit Bull. She has a flashy grey and white coat and a healthy, athletic, muscular build.
Alvina is a great size for a Pit Bull. She weighs 57# and has a well-balanced, nicely proportioned body.

Elvira has an outgoing, confident and assertive personality.  She is very friendly and attentive towards people. She loves to be petted all over and accepts hugs. We discovered that she is a couch cuddle bug and loves to get as close to you as possible.  

She walks pretty well on a leash and is doing better on slowing it down and not pulling. 

Elvira is so full of energy and life that she still sometimes jumps up. The staff and volunteers are working with her on her manners so she respects othersâ personal space and doesnât jump up any more.

She is still excitable and gets wound up like a happy, little kid. 

Elvira appears to like other dogs. However, she is very pushy when playing with other dogs in the play yard. This is something that needs to be worked on. in this case she is only somewhat sensitive to correction. Then, after proper introductions, she should do okay with them.

Elvira appears to respect cats and should do okay with them after proper introductions.

Elvira needs an individual or family with some dog owning experience. She is good natured and friendly and has a desire to please and be loved. 

She is smart and knows the command for sit.

She will need an environment where she receives a high level of activity to use up all of her energy every day. 
She is a strong, sturdy dog who loves to move her body. She should do well and bond with her new people in an obedience class to continue to teach her to be easy to handle. She would love to be your jogging or hiking or long walk companion.

Elvira is spayed, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Elvira can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center 
11232 B Avenue, Auburn, CA 95603

Shelter hours:
Monday - Saturday: 10:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Adoptions end at 4:30 p.m.)

Hi there I am Holly, 15 pounds chi, 4 years old. I am a sweet dog that doesnât bark and keeps to myself. I like dogs but not very big dogs. I feel intimidated by them. I am good with cats and kids. I was taken by Scooters when my owner kicked all of us out and we had no where to go. A Good Samaritan took me in to foster and then found Scooters. I love going shopping and on adventures. I do need to lose weight a bit but I am sure there are people who like chunky gals. You can say that I would qualify to be a therapy dog because of my demeanor.

She appears to be about 10 months old. She is spayed. microchipped and has had her vacinations. 

Poor Lacy will need an adopter who has no other pets, or a pet who is quiet and not interested in playing with her. She is afraid of everything. Pets, noise, people, other dogs. She came from a central valley shelter injured. They 'think' she was hit by a car, but I'm wondering if it is really a case of abuse.  She had a broken tail which has now been amputated half way down. When the hair grows back you probably won't notice the half gone tail. She also had a pelvic injury and a wound on her hip which has healed nicely.  

Even though her physical wounds have healed for the most part, her mental wounds still exist.  She will need a patient, gentle and loving owner who will handle her with great thoughtfulness.  It appears that Lacy was held a lot or carried by a human and she feels comfortable being held.  But she needs socialization with people and pets so she can regain her self esteme and confidence. It will take time and patience.

The swelling is gone, he is healthy again, neutered and vacinated.  He is high energy, sweet and handsome.  I am told he is 'dearlike' which means something to Chihuahua experts. We just think he is cute.  He likes his next door cell mate, likes to playwith her and is affectionate.  

Heiny came from a central valley shelter as he was living with a homeless person. He had the head injury and our nice Roseville vet rescued him from euthanasia to help Heiny out.  Now That Heiny is well again, the vet needs to place him in a good home where he will be loved and watched over so he will be safe. 

If you are interested in adoption, please call TRINA at the Cirby Sunrise Veterinary Clinic in Roseville at 1-916-780-0551 and discuss your interest and find out more about Heiny.  His adoption fee will be $200.00 and even though this does not cover Heiny's vet expenses, we will know he is in a safe and loving home. He is totally ready to go to his new home now.

Sheâs a strong-willed, loving, energetic girl who gives everything her all. Her favorite things to do are playing fetch (especially in the water like Tahoe or a pool!), snuggling up to her humans, sunbathing in a backyard or under a window, watching TV very attentively, riding shotgun in the car, and exploring the neighborhood on walks. Sheâs super attuned to her humansâ moods. She loves attention and is very attentive herself.

 Pânut was originally a rescue (I got her 3 years ago) who Iâm guessing wasnât socialized very well and therefore is pretty anxious in certain situations. Sometimes sheâll act nervous and growl/bark at new people (sheâs never bitten a person) until she gets comfortable or, more rarely, goes into timeout to calm down. She has struggled with resource guarding which can be addressed through training that I unfortunately donât have time or energy for. Over the years, she has bitten two dogs (whoâve lived with her and was otherwise friendly with) when they have tried to take her ball or food. She sometimes gets into stuff she shouldnât (mostly food and fun stuff like cardboard) when sheâs left alone too long or when sheâs bored. This can be solved by moving things out of her reach and/or more training.

An ideal home would have someone who can walk her daily and play fetch in the backyard or at a dog park frequently. Ideally they wouldnât be away at work all day, or if they are, there are others who can check in on her or give her attention throughout the day.

 I know in my heart of hearts that Pânut is a good girl who just wasnât taught how to deal with her anxiety. She has made so much progress over the few years Iâve lived with her and Iâm so proud of her! Everyone she meets can tell sheâs so full of love that she just wants to share with everyone - especially through licks and cuddles.

He is potty-trained and likes to go on walks and walks well on a leash. He sleeps quietly in a crate at night but also loves to snuggle with you in bed at night. He has been respectful of a dog savvy kitten who enjoys playing with dogs.  It's his friend of choice in his current foster home.  His first visit to Folsom Lake he walked right into the water and swam so he might be a dog who really enjoys the water. Marina is nervous around unknown humans.  It takes him a few days to warm up to a new human but once he knows you he is full of fun. Children would be too much for this shy little guy. A well matched playful mentor dog in his new home would be ideal.  A home with prior shy dog experience would be perfect.  Take your time letting this fun little guy warm up to you and we know he will win your heart. 

If you have reached out to us please be sure to check your spam folder for an email from foothillcoordinator@gmail.com! 

Marina is available for private meet and greets and does not attend our adoption events.  If you have a resident dog/s please bring them along for a meet and greet. Foothill Dog Rescue does not offer first come, first serve adoptions. Our goal is to find the best match for each dog and family. All interested parties will be interviewed to find the best match.

Dudeâs handsome face shows he may have a little Boxer in him.

Dude starts out a little timid and reserved, but quickly warms up to people.  He is independent, sensitive to correction and gentle.  He appears to not have spent a lot of time with people.  He does not understand toys so if you want a clean slat, Dude is the one for you.   Dude is very trainable and like any young animal should be taken to dog obedience for socialization and manners training.   He would make you proud.

The volunteers love Dude.  He is easy to walk and a sweet boy.  He likes to walk fast but responds if you want to slow down.  Dude remains calm around people and responds very well to corrections.  He is very friendly and receptive to body and head pets.  Around other dogs, Dude can be easily excitable

Dude is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Dude  can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center

He looks to me like he has some Labrador Retriever in him because of his facial features.  Simon has a beautiful coat and is a handsome boy.

Like any healthy young one, Simon is rambunctious, confident, excitable and assertive.  He likes to lick to show his love and is a little mouthy and can jump up into your personal space.  Luckily along with those youngster characteristics, Simon is independent, confident, affectionate and lovable.  He totally is into people and squarely centered on what you want him to do and how he fits in.  Simon loves to be petted and played with.

Simon knows how to sit and down and is learning his leash manners after he spends lots of fun time running in the play yard.  His age and personality is perfect for dog training classes.  He needs a strong pack leader and someone with dog experience.   He will need high activity exercise on a daily basis.

Simon is not sensitive to correction around cats and pulls towards them.  We do not recommend Simon be around cats in his new home.  Simon is pushy, mouthy and a little rough on introductions to other dogs so we recommend he be around submissive, tolerant, non-reactive dogs in multi-dog homes.   Proper doggy introductions will be very important. We always recommend that dogs in multiple dog families be fed separately.

Simon is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.

What a beautiful little lad this Pit Bull puppy is. He is so cute and has the prettiest brown eyes and dark markings that I enjoyed just staring at him. That is when he was standing still, which took awhile as he is highly energetic, active and rambunctious. All the qualities one would expect from a 6 month old. He has a light tan coat with a cream colored chest and cream socks. He weighs 53 #.
Billy is HAPPY and full of life. 
He is also smart and likes people so he is as attentive as he can be and he listens to you and will sit for a treat! We taught him that in the 20+ minutes we had with him in the photo room. Bright lad.
Billyâs personality is outgoing, excitable, confident and assertive. 
He is also affectionate and so willing to learn.
He is independent by nature and  he is a big strong boy. But we got the sense that the more time he spends with the staff and volunteers the more he is learning that pleasing people is a good thing and nets pets and treats and TOYS.
Billy loves toys. I think they are a novelty to him.

Billy is learning to respect othersâ personal space and not jump up, be mouthy or lick.

He is okay with other dogs with proper introductions. It is currently unknown how he will be with cats.

Billy needs lots of leash training, because it is totally new to him and he pulls hard. 
Billy will need a life with a high level of activity in it. He will thrive with structure and fun and would benefit greatly from obedience lessons.
He needs a dog savvy experienced owner or family. He is fun to be with and is healthy and beautiful. He would love a fenced, outdoor play area where he could play and run and use his energy. Come by the shelter and meet this magnificent, active pup. Dogs this age get adopted quickly.

Billy is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.

SUPER SIMPLE. 
DO NOT APPLY FOR HER IF YOU DO NOT MEET THOSE TWO BASIC REQUIREMENTS.
THANK YOU. ??)??????

What is your name? Lollie

How old are you? About 8 years old (a/o 9/04/2019)

How much do you weigh? Around 20 pounds. Iâm definitely a smaller sized French Bulldog.

What do you look like? I look like a big muscular dog in a tiny dogs body ???. Oh and also, a cow.?

What do you like to eat? Pretty much anything. I eat kibble during meal time but LOOOOOVE snacks. Any snacks. Even fruit and veggies. Give them to me. Give me all the snacks. ?

What kind of personality do you have? Iâm extremely moody and temperamental and really only like having things my way. Is that a problem??

Describe your perfect day: Iâm a pretty independent dog. I donât require much attention. BUT if you really want to show me a good time, I LOVE going for car rides. 
I love a good Starbucks drive through... 
But I canât do that âpuppachinoâ nonsense because my short snout canât fit in a cup. 
So give me a grande lid filled with whipped cream and Iâll be your BFF...

I like going to Home Depot but also need you to be conscious about other dogs that may be there. I act like a real turd-nugget sometimes when I see other dogs so itâs best you just take me down a different aisle. Sorry. ???? (Not sorry...)

I also sometimes LOVE meeting people in public, but also sometimes HATE it. 
My foster mom can help you read my body language so you can tell the difference. 
Itâs super obvious when Iâm in a good mood, and EVEN MORE obvious when Iâm not. ?

USUALLY I love the attention in big stores like Home Depot. People flock to me and I eat it up. Itâs when Iâm in smaller spaces that I canât handle the attention. Like at the Smog & Go, where the waiting room is tiny and not open. I donât like being approached in places like that. So youâll just have to keep me close to your side and let people know that I donât like strangers.

What is your favorite toy? I love stuffed toys. I like to chew on them for hours. I donât shred them. I just chew on them. I call it âself soothingâ. The one downside to giving me toys is I am a bit possessive and wonât want to give them up if you try to take them away. So just let me have my time with my toy, and when Iâm done I will let you know. Thanks in advance for understanding!?

Do you know any tricks? I know how to snort really hard and blow snot out my nose, most often when I am close to a human face. Does that count?

Oh!! And I skip when I walk!!! People comment on it all the time. Itâs super adorable. And it counts as a trick!!!!

What scares you? Too many things at once. 
Too many people. Too many noises. Too many animals. Too many things. 
I act up when Iâm overwhelmed. 
I guess you can compare it to someone with anxiety?
I just need a mellow environment and Iâm happy as a clam. ??

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I do not. I actually donât like kids at all. They stress me out and I want to bite them. But letâs get real here... that sums up about 50% of the population. So how you gonna make me out to be a bad dog when itâs NOOOORMAL to get stressed out by kids?
Right?
Whoâs with me on that one?
Anyone??
?

Do you like cats? I donât know. But probably not. I donât like other dogs all that much and cats are just like small dogs. But jerks. So I guess thatâs a no?

How do you feel about other dogs? Not so great. 
Over the past three years in my foster home, I have learned to tolerate the larger dogs that live here. They donât bother me, they donât get in my space, and they are not pushy. So I deal with them. 
But I absolutely HATE the other small dogs in my foster home. I plot their death on a regular basis and if I was allowed to take them out, I would. Unfortunately, I have a horrific underbite and I am not allowed near them. Which makes it that much more difficult to plot their demise. Oh but I can dream....

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?
In my forever home with the person that loves me and understands me enough to just let me be me. Training wonât fix me. 
CBD oil wonât fix me. 
Iâm just how I am. And I need to find someone who loves me unconditionally. 
Because I swear to you, Iâll make up for all the bad traits I have by being your most loyal, most loving little badass sidekick you ever dreamed of. 
Iâll be your very best friend. 
Iâll go everywhere with you. 
Iâll listen to your complaints about your tough day at work. 
Iâll sleep next to you at night and cuddle you. 
Iâll never let you down. ??

How is your health? Fantastic. Iâm a perfectly healthy little evil minion.

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion?
My foster moms. Theyâve kept me safe for 3 years and have put up with all my âquirksâ, but have also figured out that itâs just me. Itâs just how Iâm wired. And they love me anyway, even though Iâm a little challenging sometimes. ??????

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
In my crate. I feel really secure there and since thereâs lots of dogs in my foster home, Iâd rather not have them in my space.

Where do you sleep? In my crate. 
But when Iâve been babysat by other people, Iâve loved sleeping in bed with them. Iâve been told Iâm a great cuddler. ??

Do you like walking on a leash? Yes. I love it very much. But Iâll need you to tell people not to pet me because sometimes Iâm GREAT with strangers and sometimes I try to bite them. 
It really kind of depends on the day. 
So if you could just keep me (and them) safe by keeping their hands OFF of my tiny body, that would be amazing. And Iâd so appreciate you for it. ??

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?
Well hereâs where I need to attach my resume. 
And the reason that as a highly sought after designer breed, Iâm still in a foster home after three years. 
I like to think Iâm like a fine wine... ? 
I get better with age. ?

I have a really unique personality. I get really overwhelmed and stressed out with too much going on at once. 
I donât like other animals in my space and tend to âlash outâ if they get too close to me. 
Yes, I go after them. 
Can I hurt them? Probably not. I have a wicked underbite. But would it start a major dogfight? 
ABSOLUTELY. 
So itâs because of this that I need to be an only pet.

Along those lines, I also get pretty overwhelmed at more than one person in my life. 
I really donât know if itâs a resource guarding, jealousy, or just wanting to have my person all to myself, but more than one person just doesnât do it for me.
Itâs kind of like the wires in my brain are crossed, and I forget really quickly that Iâm friends with a person, and when they come near me when Iâm with another person, I freak out.
It honestly really sucks. 
I wish I wasnât like this. 
But I am, and you gotta take the good with the bad. 
Iâm a really great little dog that has a ton to offer for the right person. It just has to be a single person with no other pets. Iâm hoping thatâs not too much to ask for, because Iâve been waiting my WHOLE LIFE for that person.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside). 
Well... yeah. I mean for the most part. But Iâm also a frenchie and I heard we donât have to play by the same rules as âregularâ dogs. 
Iâm sure itâs an easy thing to teach me. 
But if youâre gonna get mad at me if I pee on the floor when you donât let me out, Iâm definitely not the dog for you.

Do you like playing in water?
YES!!!! Finally something I can say YES to!!!
I love water. I have a kiddie pool that I jump into on hot days. I like the lake. The river. You name it. Just donât let me go out too far. I have tiny little legs!!!

What do you love about your foster family?
Well for starters they have too many damn dogs. 
And their house is super crazy.

Oh wait. What do I LOVE about them?
Oh. Ok....

Well I love that they have kept me safe even though Iâve been a super difficult little dog.
Itâs not my fault though!!

They have a lot of dogs, and I donât like other dogs. 
So theyâve made accommodations for me and kept me safe and as happy as possible while Iâm here.

They take me out a lot so Iâm not stuck in my crate all day. 
They take me on road trips when they run errands and they take me hiking (when itâs not too hot out) and to the lakes and rivers in the area on their days off. I LOVE IT!!!

During the evening they have me spend time outdoors in a large kennel so I can be AROUND my foster parents and their other dogs, but not I have to be right in the middle of all the commotion.
I actually LOVE company, as long as Iâm not being forced to interact. 
Weird, I know. 
I especially like to roll on my back on my bed and scratch myself while I listen to Bob Marley. If there werenât lots of other dogs around and it was just me and my human, I could do the same thing. Just without the kennel. That really sounds wonderful...

What was your life like before being joining NBBR?
Ugh. To be honest, it was shit. Originally I was raised in a home with my brother. Our owners went through a divorce and my mom moved out, leaving me with a very abusive dad who took out his anger over the divorce on me and my brother. We were locked in closets for days on end, and I got kicked around pretty badly. I am extremely sensitive on my hind end, and even though I have no injuries, tend to freak out if anybody tries to push me along or move me with their foot. I scream super loudly even if Iâm not being touched. 
It just scares me. 
So I act out.

Marley is a 3 year old, healthy, muscular girl who weighs 58 # and has a shiny, silver grey and white coat and beautiful grey -green eyes. 

Marley has an outgoing, confident, independent and assertive personality.  
She is affectionate and is friendly and attentive towards people.
She likes to be petted and accepts being touched and hugged. Marley can be excitable and slower to recover, but on the other hand she is sensitive to verbal correction.

The volunteers and staff have complimentary feedback about how nicely she walks on a leash. 
They are working on her other doggie manners so that she respects peoples personal space and doesnt jump up or lick or be mouthy. Marley is smart and she is trying hard to learn how to behave in a way that pleases. She is receptive to training and sensitive to correction. 

Marley will be fun to train. She knows how to sit and shake hands. She is potty trained. She has good eye contact when you relate to her. 
Marley loved sitting right next to us on the sofa for petting and cuddles.
She took great pleasure in trying every toy in the room that we gave her to play with. The squeaky ones delighted her and she jumped up on the sofa and had so much fun making noise with them! It seemed like it might have been the first time she had ever had this kind of play time. So cute to watch.

Marley appears to like other dogs and with proper introductions should do okay with LARGE DOGS. 
We recommend that dogs in multiple dog families be fed separately.

Marley needs a home with NO CATS. 

Marley will need a life filled with high energy activities. She will benefit greatly from obedience training, which will cement a healthy bond between her and her new person or family. 
She will do great with dog savvy, experienced owners. She is ready to become your new friend and add sweetness and fun to your life.
 
Marley is spayed, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  Marley can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center, 11232 B Avenue, Auburn, CA 95603

Shelter hours:
Monday - Saturday: 10:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Adoptions end at 4:30 p.m.)
Closed Sundays and County holidays

I am 9 years and 3 months old.

Raja is an incredibly special gal, who truly just needs someone to love! She is that wonderful age where she's both up for outings, and happy to snuggle at home. We've found her to be confident and easy going with other dogs, and quite easy to walk on leash, too! But her true passion is petting. All she really wants is for someone to shower her with affection, and tell her what a gorgeous gal she is. Raja (like most dogs) finds being in the shelter quite stressful, so if you pass by her kennel she may make a ruckus, but don't let that deter you - ask an adoptions counselor to meet her, and you'll soon find a velvety soft snuggle pup, waiting to become the devoted companion you've been looking for! 

My adoption fee was sponsored by a loving fan!

I lived with dogs in my previous home.
I don't have a history with cats, but may do well with them with a slow introduction.
I don't have a history with children but may do well with them."

		Cristiano is a three year old black and tan male. He was surrendered to a local vet so not much is known about his background. We do know he previously lived with a small dog and has greeted all sized dogs nicely since coming into rescue. He is currently living with a female shepherd. They only play occasionally, but he does love the companionship of having her around. 

		Cristiano is housebroken and has pretty nice manners while inside, but if left unsupervised he may help himself to the trash can if the opportunity presents itself. While he will sleep in a crate at night he does not like to be left alone in the crate and may cry loudly or attempt to get out if left alone. He will prefers to sleep freely on a dog bed in his foster moms room at night. 

		Cristiano is still learning to heel and walk on a leash without pulling.  He is also learning basic commands and to sit and wait for his meals. Cristiano has shown signs of pretending not to know basic commands such as sit when asked by new people. If you stay firm and consistent, he will eventually give in and sit. This boy is pretty food motivated as well so if he discovers he won't get his meal until he obeys he will cave in. 

		Cristiano can get a little jealous when he sees the other dog getting attention. He often needs a reminder to sit and wait his turn. 

		Cristiano will do best in a home that will include him in their daily activities. Continued training and proper leadership is essential to help him flourish and become a wonderful addition to the family.					


This dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.

For more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. 

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State.

Born on July 4th of this year, Thomas and his litter mates are now 8 weeks old.  While his litter mates were thriving, we noticed Thomas was starting to fall behind.  Thomas was diagnosed with Megaesophagus.  Megaesophagus is an enlargement of the esophagus which limits the ability for food to move into the stomach. Great Danes, along with several other breeds, are predisposed to this condition.  We are working closely with our vet to determine how best to treat Thomas going forward and ensure he gets enough nutrients.  Like most special need dogs, Thomas doesnât know he is different.  He is learning to eat in an upright position and remain upright for an extended period after eating. He is a typical happy go lucky puppy who loves people and playing with his siblings.  We are looking for a very special home for Thomas. Someone familiar this condition would be ideal.  All puppies require someone around enough to teach them manners and proper behaviors.  Thomas will require a bit more attention during feeding time. We know that special home for Thomas is out there.  Please share to make the connection between Thomas and his perfect home happen. 

If you have reached out to us please be sure to check your spam folder for an email from foothillcoordinator@gmail.com! 

Thomas not your jam? No worries! Check out all the available dogs on our Facebook page or website (www.foothilldogrescue.org).

I've been living with a family for the past year who love me but just don't have the time it takes to give me what I need.  I am being rehomed due to a change in my family and I'm waiting with my owner in Reno, NV.  I need someone with some GSD and training experience. And definitely someone interested in taking me to a training class or two.    I'm a very good girl, I just need a little work...  I've lived with  3 cats and while we're not BFF's I was OK living with them.  I just want to play. I am good with other dogs.   I love to go for walks and walk pretty well, however, I could use some loose leash practice.... I know Sit, Down, and can give you my Paw.  If you want a dog who loves to play Fetch, well, that's Me!  I've lived with young children from 2-4 years old but can be a bit rambunctious for them, so children 10 and up might be better. I am house trained, crate trained, as I'm still a puppy, and I'm excellent drving in the car.  I'm current on vaccinations, heartworm negative, spayed and microchipped.

Iâm very sweet and just want to be around my people most of the time. I like to play and go for walks, but also donât mind laying at your feet if thatâs what you need me to do.

Describe your perfect day:
First Iâd have breakfast. Then go for a nice walk. After that I like to take a nap for a couple hours. Then maybe have some play time in a yard before another nap or just quiet hangout time with my person. After that an evening walk then just dinner and hangout time till bed.

What is your favorite toy?
I really like stuffed toys. Iâm pretty gentle with them too. They wear out eventually but I donât pull the stuffing out of them or anything.

Do you know any tricks?
I can sit, lay down, and stay (as long as you donât go too far). I will also wait until you give me permission to eat food you put on the floor and will (usually) walk into my crate if you tell me âkennelâ. My foster mom is still working on come with me, but I donât like to venture too far from my people anyways.

What scares you?
New people coming into the house. Sometimes Iâm a little apprehensive with new people other places too, but itâs mostly just the house.

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I havenât been around small children. My foster mom has to cousins (12 and 14) that come over almost everyday and play with me. Iâm great with them, but they know thereâs a strict no roughhousing/fighting rule around me because I can be protective. I also get excited sometimes and am not terribly aware of my size so itâs probably best if Iâm not around small kids.

Do you like cats?
My foster family has two cats. Iâm only allowed around them if Iâm on a leash, but I donât pay any attention to them even if they run right by me.

How do you feel about other dogs?
I do well with other dogs with proper introductions and supervision.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? 
Wherever my people are.

How is your health?
Great! I have some allergies, but thatâs no big deal.

Who do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion?
My foster mom, her grandma and two cats. I like my foster mom the most, but Grandma is also nice.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
In my crate.

Where do you sleep? 
Mostly in my crate.

Do you like walking on a leash?
YES! I love walks! Theyâre my favorite part of the day and I am very well behaved. I mostly just want to smell everything.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?
I can get excited and jump on people. Also Iâm protective of the house/my people so you have to be very cautious with strangers. Itâs important that Iâm kenneled or in another room when people first come in the house, but I seem to adjust after some time and a few treats.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside)
Yes.

Do you like water?
Only to drink. Iâll tolerate a bath but thatâs it.

What do you love about your foster family?
They spend lots of time with me and give me lots of treats. Mostly just that they saved me.

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue?
I was dumped in a park near my foster familyâs house. I was very, very skinny and afraid of people, so sheâs pretty sure I wasnât being treated very well. My foster family has shown me lots of love though, and Iâm really excited to find my forever home!

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Samson's adoption donation is $200.

I am Groot!

How old are you? 1

How much do you weigh? 14lbs

What do you look like? Erm..cute? Brown, short legs, slight overbite with big expressive round eyes

What do you like to eat? I like dry kibble for everyday. Iâd do ANYTHING for chicken and peanut butter

What kind of personality do you have? Iâm a happy, active and independent puppy. I like to play and cuddle but I am also good at entertaining myself.

Describe your perfect day:
Start with morning potty outside followed by cuddle time with momma and breakfast. I like playing with my foster siblings and play tag. I like to eat 3x a day. Naps and play during the day and a treat right before bedtime.

What is your favorite toy?
I LOVE toys. Any of them! I like picking them up and showing momma how cute I am when she gets home.

Do you know any tricks?
Iâm quite talented. I know sit, lay down, stay, kiss kiss and might even dance for you when Iâm compensated well. I donât want to admit it but I understand âquietâ and ânoâ very well.

What scares you?
Very loud noises. I used to be scared of vehicles but not anymore.

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
No children in the house of foster momma.

Do you like cats? 
Iâm not sure.

How do you feel about other dogs?
I get along well with my 2 foster sibs. I LOVE to run and chase and play tug of war.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?
Sitting on mamas lap outside with the sun on my face.

How is your health?
Active, strong and healthy

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion?
I live with foster momma and papa, and 2 puppers, Leelu and Data. I like playing with Leelu most because she likes to run and plays tug of war with me. I also love my solo times with foster momma.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
I have my private space in the kitchen/living room. My kennel there is left open inside the gated area. I am a quiet boy when left alone. I only bark when somebody wants to break in.

Where do you sleep?
My crate. You tell me âinsideâ and itâs automatic but I do it even faster with a treat.

Do you like walking on a leash?
Yes! I like to take my time walking and sniffing everything. But I can jog along up to a couple miles!

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?
I am protective of my treats. But I am learning I donât have to be scared or protective of it. Toys keep me away from breaking anything.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) yes! I prefer going outside to potty but Iâm ok with pee pad too. I WILL let you know if I have to go.

Do you like playing in water?
Sometimes. I like chasing the water from the hose when foster momma is cleaning the patio. I LOVE baths, does that count?

What do you love about your foster family?
Momma makes sure that I get my solo time with her. My sibs are fun to play with. I love emptying the toy basket and playing with every single toy in there!

What was your life like before being joining NBBR?
I was surrendered to be killed because of biting. But NBBR wasnât given full background on how the behavior happened. Momma thinks I have been abused.

In my foster home, the only time I showed aggression was around treats. And it only happened 3x in the first 3 weeks. Nobody was ever hurt. And no fighting with my foster sibs as well. I am being trained to learn that I donât need to protect my treat. I did not get aggressive in the open. Only when Iâm inside my kennel. I like to be left alone until Iâm done with my treat.

The bad behavior was corrected by foster momma patiently showing me that I wasnât going to get hurt. She ignored me when I growled and left me alone to eat. The training I went through is being told to âleave itâ so I donât go for a treat thatâs right in front of me, then she gives me a different treat when I listen.

Once I was good with that, we moved on to taking the current treat from me. Sheâll give me a treat, come close, when I growl she tells me ânoâ and shows me she has another treat and tells me to sit. I sit and she gives me the new treat while taking the old one. We practiced this 3x a day for two weeks! No more growling. I donât get any treat at all if I donât follow what she says.

??SPECIAL NEED:??

I cannot be adopted by first time dog owner. This is because I am still a puppy and have been through a lot. I have a big personality that tests limits sometimes. I need someone to be in charge who can lovingly teach and show me my boundaries in the home. I am very loyal and protective of my family and great companion pupper.

Are you looking for a gorgeous girl who is good with dogs, cats and even chickens?! Then look no further because Reagan is your girl!!!

What is your name? Reagan

How old are you? Iâm about 6 years old.

How much do you weigh? Iâm about 60lbs.

What do you look like? Iâm mostly brindle with a white belly and chest, some white on my feet, a black muzzle and black around my eyes which make my eyes stand out.

What do you like to eat? Anything and everything! I get kibble at meal time and training treats, bits of cheese, veggies, or meat when I do good. Those are my favorite! I also sneak over to the chickenâs crumble when Iâm outside and they share with me! There hasnât been anything I havenât liked yet.

What kind of personality do you have? Iâm told that Iâm the sweetest, most lovable girl ever! I make friends everywhere I go. Iâm a big pleaser. I always check in with my human to make sure that theyâre happy with what Iâm doing. I would take belly rubs and pets over anything and will stare into your eyes the whole time youâre petting me. Iâm calm when Iâm in the house or my crate but love walks, hiking or chasing my ball outside!

Describe your perfect day: My perfect day would be waking up with my family, going outside to stretch and potty, then have breakfast. Then go for a walk around the neighborhood before coming back for a long nap. After my nap we would play in the backyard, Iâd lay out to sunbathe on the lawn and then fetch my ball until it was dinner time and get one more nap in. After dinner I would hang out in the yard while my foster mom waters everything then itâd be bedtime.

What is your favorite toy? My favorite toy right now is my blue solid kong ball! I take it in my crate with me so it doesnât get lost and love chasing it outside. Iâm told Iâm not very gentle with stuffing filled toys, apparently Iâm not supposed to shred them... who knew??

Do you know any tricks? I know sit, down (lay down), stay, and I know not to jump up on people! I know when Iâm told âeasyâ while being given a treat to take it gently from my humans hand. My foster mom swears I know what âgo pottyâ and âdinnerâ mean. I also know to fetch the ball but Iâm still learning drop... I prefer keeping the ball until I get belly rubs and then Iâll let you grab it from my mouth. Win-win.

What scares you? I donât like super loud noises or the hose.

Have you been around children? Do you like them? My human foster sister is 9 and we have lots of fun. I havenât been around any babies or really young children but I probably would really like them too. I like all people because people = pets and belly rubs!

Do you like cats? YEP! I know to be gentle with them. I just wish theyâd play more instead of lying around the house all day.

How do you feel about other dogs? Dogs are okay with slow proper introductions. I love my older foster dog brother, my little foster dog sister is kind of crazy and a lot to handle sometimes.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? Anywhere with people, especially MY people.

How is your health? My health is great now! I was rescued from the shelter with a tumor on my neck that I was going to be âput to sleepâ for.... whatever that means. But I got lucky! NBBR came for me and got me the best care. I had surgery to remove it all. Iâm now all healed up and they say I have a clean bill of health!

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? I live with my foster mom, foster dad, my foster human sister, my older foster dog brother, my younger foster dog sister, two older foster cat sisters and five really big foster bird sisters that the humans call chickens. Iâm closest to my foster mom because she works from home and spends allll day with me!

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? I stay in my crate when my humans arenât home. I actually like it in there... I have bones to chew on, my ball and a comfy bed that is all mine.

Where do you sleep? My crate.

Do you like walking on a leash? Yep! A leash means I get to go on a walk. Every once in awhile Iâll pull a little if I smell something really good or see people that obviously really want to pet me but I know not to drag my human.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? My foster mom says not really, she says I behave better than my foster dog brother and sister! Iâm not a big barker but sometimes Iâll chime in when the other foster dogs bark but my foster mom says thatâs not my fault because my little foster dog sister usually starts it over nothing and Iâm just backing her up.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside). Of course, Iâm 6! Iâve only had one accident since I came to my foster home over two months ago. Iâm very proud of that because it makes my humans happy! Iâll go potty before bed and hold it for up to 8-9 hours until morning and I go outside. On the rare occasion I forget to go potty while Iâm outside before bed.... Iâll whine for my human to let me outside to go potty really quick.

Do you like water? I like drinking water and putting my feet in the water but Iâm not a big swimmer.

What do you love about your foster family? I love that they have taken such good care of me and spend so much time with me. They make me feel safe. Theyâve also taken me to do lots of new things like camping and riding in a boat.

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? I was adopted from the shelter as a puppy by my old family but returned six years later to the same shelter when I got the funny lump on my neck. I was at that noisy, scary shelter for about a month before NBBR came and saved me! I have been at my foster home ever since and Iâm finally ready to find my forever home with a family that will love me no matter what!

Dewey is a 4 year old, male Chinese Sharpei Pit Bull Terrier mix.
He is so cute with all of his Sharpei worried-looking wrinkles and his soulful Pit Bull eyes that when you see him, you just want to get to know him!
He is a stocky boy and weighs 66.5# of muscle.
His coat is black with a hint of brindle mixed in and he has handsome white markings on his chest. 
As soon as we took Dewey in to get to know him and take his photos, our first impressions were that this is a loving dog who is also pushy and demanding! He wants to please and be liked but doesnât know patience yet. He loves to be petted and liked cuddling and snuggling on the sofa. When we introduced him to stuffed animal toys he buried his face in their softness like he had never experienced such fun and pleasure. It was adorable to watch.
Dewey is excitable and it takes him awhile to calm down. He has a bundle of energy that needs to be directed towards proper channels. He will need a life with medium to high level activities.
He needs to continue to learn how to walk properly on a leash as he still pulls and is quite strong.  He is smart and he is so happy to be with people that it is just a matter of time until he makes the connection that walking nicely makes people like him more. He loves treats and will pay attention to you to earn them.

Dewey is very pushy with other dogs and is not very sensitive to correction about this behavior. We think he will do best in a home where he is the only dog.
He will do best in a home with no cats. He becomes intensely focused when he sees a cat and pulls hard to chase them.

Dewey is a handsome, lovable, wonderful guy who needs a dog savvy, experienced person or family to adopt him. He has a fun goofy side to him that is really enjoyable to be around. He is also confident and assertive, and so he needs boundaries and he needs to view his new person(s) as pack leaders. Dewey would benefit tremendously from obedience classes which will guide him in the right direction and form a wonderful bond with his new people. 

Dewey is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Dewey can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center 
11232 B Avenue, Auburn, CA 95603

Monday - Saturday: 10:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Adoptions end at 4:30 p.m.)

When he turned 7 months old, this 7-lb. Rattie mix was rescued from an environment where he had little contact with humans. And after just 7 days, Milo had determined that people weren't so scary after all. He stopped running from his foster mom and started cozying up to her on the couch. Now he's settling in and beginning to work on house-training, walking on leash, and some basic commands. Milo is a good pup, who sleeps quietly in his crate at night and gets along with other dogs as long as they're calm and gentle. (Bossy, rough-housing dogs are scary.) Milo will still need time and patience to overcome his early months of deprivation, but he's fairly certain that a nurturing human who wants to help is reading about him right now. Talk about luck!

Hi there Lucy here, 15 pounds, chi Mix, 8 years old. I am looking to spend the rest of my life peacefully as I was saved by Scooters from a high kill shelter. Since then I have had my dental and have a clean bill of health. I like other dogs and am super sweet but I donât like to be picked up unless I know you well enough.

However someone did a great job on training her! She is potty trained, knows basic commands, is great with car rides, and loves going along on errands. Her two favorite things are snuggles and walks, mainly snuggles. She can be a little shy at first but once she warms up she will be glued to you and melt your heart. Ms. Lula has a small dog body and is believed to be mixed with Rat Terrier, chihuahua, and/or dachshund but her color, tail, and wiggle butt are 100% beagle. She has the cutest ears, one perks up and one lops back! We believe she may have had to fend for herself for a bit as she was food territorial at first and did try to scavenge but with some coaxing and love she has drastically improved. She is good with other dogs but would be great in a home where she can get lots of attention, a lap to lay in, and someone to curl up in bed next to as we do not believe she is crate trained. If youâre looking for a mellow girl with a load of love and personality to snuggle with, Ms. Lula is youâre girl!"

She is now available for adoption!?

What is your name? Gracie

How old are you? About 3 years old

How much do you weigh? About 60 lbs

What do you look like? 
Iâm short and cute ? I have beautiful grey and white fur and beautiful hazel eyes.

What do you like to eat?
Kibble and treats are good but I also like carrots and apples with some peanut butter!

What kind of personality do you have?
Iâm an outgoing girl. Once Iâve warmed up to you Iâll show you Iâm very playful and love to give kisses lots of kisses. 

Describe your perfect day:? 
My perfect day would be getting up to you! Going for a walk, having breakfast and playing in the yard with a friend or toys. Then hanging out with you in or out of the house. Iâm down for anything especially road trips! I love car rides and I stay very calm in the back seat. 

What is your favorite toy? 
I love anything that squeaks  

Do you know any tricks?
I know sit, wait, easy and crate. I love to play fetch too! 

What scares you? 
If you raise your voice because I think your mad at me.

Have you been around children? Yes, teenagers and I love them. I havenât been around younger children but Iâm sure I would love them too. 

Do you like cats?
I am very interested in cats and my foster mom is teaching me to be calm around them. 

How do you feel about other dogs? 
Other dogs are great. I havenât met one I didnât like ?

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be ?
With you where ever you go. 

How is your health?
Now Iâm in good shape. My foster mom has taken good care of me. I do have a 2-3 heart murmur, what ever that is, it doesnât slow me down as I run and play like all the other dogs. 

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? 
My foster family consists of my foster mom, my foster fur sisters and fur brother. 

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
In my crate! My crate is in the family room so I can be near my foster fur sisters and fur brother. 

Where do you sleep?
In my crate in my foster momâs room

Do you like walking on a leash? 
Oh yes! Iâm very good on a leash. I never pull and stay right next to you. 

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? 
Nope, but I will alert bark when I sense you need to know something is going on. 

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside): yes, Iâm very good at going potty outside. My foster mom lets me go potty before she leaves for work and again when she gets home. Iâm good and never potty in my crate. Once my foster mom is home and on weekends I use the dog door. I love that thing! 

Do you like playing in water? 
I havenât been to the lake yet but Iâm not afraid of the hose and baths are not a problem. 

What do you love about your foster family? 
I love that my foster mom has been patient with me while I learned the rules of the house. I feel happy and safe there. My fur sisters and fur brother are fun to play with too. 

What was your life like before being joining NBBR?
My human family wasnât the best. They kept me crated and making babies. That was my past and Iâm looking forward to my future with you.

*NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread throughout the Sacramento area. We require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog and the home. This allows us to complete a yard check to guarantee the applicant's yard is secure, and have the dog close enough should any behavioral issues arise. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather based on what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary).

**Interested in meeting Gracie or any of our available pooches? Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

Sheba is a very sweet and patient 5 year old âmicro bullyâ pit bull, very small. She loves to go for rides, she loves to swim in the creek or a puddle big enough, but her favorite past time is napping and cuddling. Sheba is very low energy, but still loves to play ( mostly shredding toys/balls). She loves other dogs but shouldnât be in a home with cats whatsoever. She has never really been around children but Iâm sure sheâd do great with age appropriate kids. She loves her kennel (itâs her safe space) she does not chew, she doesnât bark/howl unless thereâs a fire truck with its sirens on.

I have lost my home and job and need to return to Switzerland in less then 3 weeks. This is all very heart breaking bit I am not able to bring him over seas with me.
He is a pleaser and the ultimate cuddler. He listens and walks almost perfect on the leash. We had contact with a lot of different people, children, and even cats and he is very mellow. His personality is a little on the any side and I realizes that hiking men with big hats and backpacks and sticks scared him. Other than that, he is perfect.
He is not food aggressive at all and loves the outdoors. He is a great hiker and learned how to swim. But not crazy obsessed about water. He listens so very well and seems to understand what I need and want from him before I verbally address it.
I had him wait in the car for over 1 hour and he just sleeps away, waiting without destroying anything. I love him so much but do not see a future for myself here anymore. Very sad but hopeful to find him a forever home through you.

Age: ~14 months
Weight: 55 pounds
Energy: Moderate to high
Drive: Moderate
Location: Grass Valley, California

If you like water, you'll love Minnow. This energetic girl took to it like, well, a minnow! At her first swimming lesson, she progressed from zero to full throttle in about 15 minutes, quickly deciding to jump in the pool on her own. Now there's no stopping her. Water makes her silly and happy and playful. She'll retrieve a toy on land if she must, but will fetch gleefully if it's thrown in the pool. Dock diving is an obvious choice for formal sports. When she's not jumping in the pool, she's off exploring with her nose, so competitive nosework is another option. Whatever she does for exercise, she'll need a lot of it, every day.

An active family could play team tag to keep her busy; when one arm gets tired of throwing, someone else's could take over. But fun as she is, Minnow needs more than just play. She needs someone committed to providing her with firm, structured learning, as she can be stubborn if pushed the wrong way. However, with the right approach, Minnow tries hard to learn what's wanted. She's smart and food-motivated. A trainer or someone working with a trainer will help bring out Minnow's best.

One thing Minnow needs work on is barking, or rather not barking. She can't stand being left out, and will make your ears pay for it if you have fun without her. As long as she's included she doesn't bark. Getting her worn out with playing helps too. She's learning to control the barking some, but will need appropriate, consistent training to overcome the habit. Although she has not pottied in the house and she doesn't tear things up when free, she'll need a little work on continuing to learn what's okay in the house and on not tearing up anything hanging on her crate.

Minnow's other main area for improvement is her reaction to some dogs. She tries to dominate them, which is not always well received. Exposure to other dogs while wearing a muzzle seems to be helping her learn to just sniff briefly and walk along. A loving, patient, but firm and knowledgeable person would be perfect for helping her catch up on social skills. She would do best as a single dog or in a home with a larger male.

With people, Minnow is a sweetheart. She loves everyone and especially loves to cuddle. She's great at the vet's, making friends with all the staff, and is fine albeit overexcited with visitors. She's shown no aggression toward children but might try to dominate them if allowed, by jumping on them for instance. Since Minnow is so affectionate she'd probably love to sleep with her people but she accepts a crate at night (and in the car) as well, with a little coaxing to lure her in. Or maybe she'd be happy sleeping on a float in the pool ....

Bailey is a 4 year old, spayed Plot Hound Mix. She is a healthy girl and up on all her shots and preventatives and a great watchdog. She is sweet, loyal and loving. Bailey loves to run around and occasionally chase the UPS driver from the other side of the fence. Bailey knows some basic commands but could use some additional training. She loves the snow and is good in the water. She is very good working with treats and loves to chew a bone. She comes when called and does not mind being outside or inside whichever you would like. She is known to be a couch dog. We do not recommend another dog in the house. Further, she is known to havea lot of energy at times so she may not be suitable for children. Bailey needs a new home because there is another dog in the house, and a new baby just two weeks ago.

Well here is your chance to add a little magic to your life!

Magic is a beautiful, medium sized, 55 # female Pit Bull Terrier Mix. She is  5 years old, and has a red/brindle coat with a splash of white under her chin and a white blaze on her chest.

She is affectionate and attentive towards people. She is confident, outgoing and independent.  She has a calm nature,  and can be reserved and sensitive. Magic loves to spend time with staff and volunteers.   She has so much love to give. She will be a devoted companion.  

She is very sweet and mellow. She loves to go on walks and has good leash manners. She will walk right by your side.

Magic knows how to sit, but we think she can be taught any obedience skill if enough time is given to training.  
She is smart and is  receptive to correction.  She may get in you personal space but she wants to please so she will listen to what you want her to do.

Magic  wants to pull towards cats and wants to chase, so introductions and selective choices will be important with Magic.  She is somewhat sensitive to correction when being around cats so you may be able to work with her.
Magic is very pushy around dogs but may be OK if the dog is submissive and leaves her alone.  She does not like dogs within her space.  Just like the cats above, she is selective with dogs and proper introductions are a must.  A savvy and experienced dog owner is recommended. 

Magic is a sweet girl who loves to cuddle on the couch and be petted as she snuggles. She also loves to play with toys. We gave her a squeaky toy and she seemed amazed by it, like a little puppy would be, which led us to think it may have been a first for her! Wouldnât it be great to be the person or family who spoils this special dog with toys and attention, maybe for the very first time in her 5 year life ?

Magic is spayed,  microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Magic can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center

Frank is a strikingly handsome blue-eyed Pit Bull Terrier. He has a flashy black, white and brindle, smooth coat and a muscular 80# body. He is around 7 years old, which qualifies him for our Seniors for Seniors special, where his adoption fee is waived for approved adopters over the age of 55!

Frank might be a little reserved when he first meets you but warms up quickly. In fact we discovered he is a big-time cuddle-bug and he loves to snuggle right up to you on the sofa. He would sit his 80 pounds of love right on your lap if heâd fit!

He is full of confident personality and is getting used to the leash and the staff and volunteers see improvement in his leash manners. They said he is super relaxed and wonderful on the leash. 

Frank is a sweetie and is smart and responsive and sensitive to correction. He is careful and gentle and independent.
He is becoming more relaxed at the shelter and is more friendly and attentive towards people. He was nervous about being touched or petted when he first arrived but you can see by his photos that he is now showing his affection and comfort with people. 

Frank loves balls and gets very excited when he is in the chill room or play yard with one.

He appears to respect cats and should be okay with them after proper introductions.
He should also be okay with other dogs with proper introductions, although he might be shy or a little pushy, and he is only slightly sensitive to correction under those circumstances.

Frank is the complete package. He is beautiful, lovable, smart, warm and affectionate. He has paid attention to expectations during the short time he has been in the shelter and has continued to learn and grow and will easily fit into a new domestic environment.

He will need an adopter or a family with dog savvy and dog owning experience. He will need low to medium level activity in his life.  Frank will make someone a fun, loyal walking companion or a pup who will play fetch in the backyard.

Make Frank - aka Mr Blue Eyes, part of your family and you will have a loyal, sweet companion beside you.

Frank is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Frank can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center 
11232 B Avenue, Auburn, CA 95603

Weighing a petite 10 lbs., 1-year-old Mia is quite shy but ever so eager to please her people. She has adjusted nicely to her foster home, and she's sure to fit right into your home too. She gets along with her two female foster sisters, both Rat Terriers, but she's especially fond of her foster brother, a big Golden Retriever! Mia settles down quickly for the night in her crate and walks politely on leash. She's working on house-training and basic commands and making good progress on both. Wouldn't you love to adopt a cutie like Mia? Check out more photos of Mia in her online album at http://imageevent.com/newrattitude/mia .

Act fast, because? LUKAS ? is available! Young, smart, and water loving ?

What is your name? 
Lukas

How old are you? 
Less than one year old (a/o 7/29)

How much do you weigh? 
About 60lbs

What do you look like? 
I am grey and white with the most beautiful matching grey eyes. My face is white with a grey patch and my body is mostly grey.

What do you like to eat? 
I currently eat Nutro puppy food but my humans havenât found anything I wonât eat yet. I love treats!

What kind of personality do you have? 
I am active and love to play. Once I have played for a while I will lay day and relax while watching a movie as long as I have a bone or toy to chew on. Once the movie is over I am usually ready to play again.

Describe your perfect day: 
My perfect day would be to explore the backyard or go for a walk. Once I have tired myself out I would love to relax near humans. I also love to go for car rides. And I love to eat. I would be happy doing anything with people.

What is your favorite toy? 
I think everything is a toy. I especially love anything I can carry around with me or chew on. I like balls but I am still learning to bring them back after someone gives them to me.

Do you know any tricks? 
I know sit, wait, shake, leave it, and down. I will do just about anything for treats and am eager to learn. My fosters also taught me to ring a bell before I go outside. I havenât learned to use it to let them know when I need to go outside on my own yet.

What scares you? 
I am not afraid of loud noises but Iâm still trying to figure out my humans robot vacuum. It doesnât scare me too much but I am still trying to figure it out.

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I have only met one small child and I was so excited. My fosters think I would

Do you like cats? 
My fosters donât have any cats so they havenât been able to introduce me to one.

How do you feel about other dogs? 
The shelter says I tested well with dogs. My foster sister is a senior girl and a little cranky. I finally won her over and she plays chase with me! Sometimes I get too excited and she corrects men but I am the perfect gentleman and I do whatever she says.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? Anywhere with people. I love to go on walks and explore things outside with them.

How is your health? I am in great health.

Who do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion? 
I live with adults in my foster home. And I love them so much. I donât really know which one is my favorite because I love everyone. I also live with an older resident dog but we havenât spent any one on one time together. She is a bit overwhelmed by my happy disposition.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? 
When my foster parents are not home I nap in my crate.

Where do you sleep? 
I sleep in my crate

Do you like walking on a leash? 
I love to go for walks and do really well. Sometimes I get excited and have to be reminded to continue on my walk.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? I am a puppy so my foster parents are constantly reminding me that I can't chew on everything. When I get really excited I try to nibble on anything but they do a really good job of reminding me to âleave itâ and redirecting me. My fosters give me lots of toys but if I am not supervised I have been know to find a shoe. I'm a puppy, remember?

I also like to jump. When I get really excited, I need to be reminded of âoffâ. When my fosters let me out of my crate I get really excited. It helps when they put me on a leash and take me right out side to potty. Usually I have calmed down enough by then that I remember my manners.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) 
I go potty outside but my foster parents keep a really good eye on me so that I donât have any accidents.

Do you like water? 
I think the hose is the greatest thing in the world. My foster parents are working with me on self control because I am so in love with it that I forget anything else exists when water comes out of it. I have played in a kiddie pool but we havenât been able to go to the river or any lakes.

What do you love about your foster family? 
I love when they take me for walks and scratch my back. If I could be anywhere in the world it would be with people.

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue?
My fosters arenât really sure what life was like before I came to the rescue. Someone left me tied to a shelter door and they contacted NBBR. My foster said they called NBBR because I am so sweet (and adorable) so they came and rescued me. I was limping when they first rescued me but after lots of rest I am walking perfectly.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Lukas's adoption donation is $350.

Interested in meeting Lukas or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

He was healthy and in good shape, and luckily he was also microchipped, so he was reunited with his owners. Six months later, Angus once again found himself at the shelter, only this time his owners didnât come to claim him, and he was in bad shape: his right leg is non-functioning, his spine is out of whack, and he has scars all over his body. Though weâll never know exactly what happened to Angus in the six months between leaving the shelter and coming back, it definitely wasnât good.

In spite of everything, Angus is a sweetheart! His body may be broken, but his spirit isnât; he still trusts people, and isnât reactive to other dogs in non-stressful settings. He is working through some separation anxiety, which isnât surprising given what little we know of his history, and will have his medical needs assessed and addressed before going to a forever home. In general, he just wants to be touched, hugged, scratched, and loved. His resilience is astounding!

She was literally down to her last day on Earth and scheduled to be euthanized at 5:00pm, and lucky for us all she made it out by 4:30pm!

Upon getting Bella in to a vet post-shelter decompression, it was discovered that Bella isnât a mama or granny after all â sheâs actually quite young, and an ultrasound determined that she is not pregnant! Bella has clearly had at least one previous litter, and likely lived a pretty rough life on the streets given the state of her teeth, but thatâs all in the past now!

Lola spent the first two years of her life in a trailer park with her first family, and had 3 litters of puppies before the park landlord evicted her family. As plans were being made to find a foster for Lola and pups, the landlord ran and out of patience and threatened to kill the dogs if they werenât moved off the property immediately. With time all but run out, an amazing foster home stepped up to the plate, and Lola and her babies were rushed out of danger.

Since coming into foster, Lola has proven herself to be a complete sweetheart! She takes a few moments to grow accustomed to new people, but once sheâs comfortable her true personality comes out, and sheâs a sweet, patient goof. She loves her foster family (especially foster dad and the kids!) and is doing an amazing job taking care of her five chunky pups.

Lola will be ready to begin separating from her puppies once they turn 8-9 weeks old, and sheâll be spayed, fully vetted, and ready to find a wonderful forever home when that time comes.

Max is a handsome, lovable, 3 year old Pit Bull Terrier Mix. He has a flashy black, brindle and white coat with a white blaze on his chest and white paws. I think his mix could be with Great Dane based on the sort of flappy lips he has and the shape of his muzzle. He s a good sized guy, weighing in at 68#.

Max is young, outgoing, and full of life. He enjoys his environment and the people in it. He is truly a sweet, smart dog who will make your home a special place, filled with love and happiness. 

He is loved by the staff who compliment his leash manners and call him a âgood boy.â He likes to roll in the grass. 
Max is affectionate and responsive and sensitive to correction. He knows how to sit and to lie down. 
He is attentive to people and likes to be petted.

Max appears to respect selective cats, although he did give the indication that he will chase cats. Therefore we consider his behavior with cats to be âunknown.â

He does appear to be okay with dogs, although slightly shy. Of course , proper, careful introductions need to be made.

Max will need owner(s) who will help him through his heartworm treatment. He is doing well and can be adopted now (*see Special Needs section) He is a low activity dog currently. When he is well, he will be a medium activity dog.
He will do best with an owner or family with some dog owning experience.

Max is ready to be your dog. He is quick and bright and likes to please. He is learning to respect othersâ personal space and not lick or jump up. After he calms down, his gentle side emerges and he wants to be right by your side. 
He is a completely loyal companion and would love to become part of your world.

Max is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Max can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center

What is your name? Honey

How old are you?
My foster parents think Iâm around 7 â in my opinion, Iâm aging like fine wine

How much do you weigh?
Around 60 pounds

What do you look like?
I am light brown with a pretty white chest and feet

What do you like to eat?
ANYTHING you offer me! But not tomatoes

What kind of personality do you have?
I can be quite timid of new people at first, if they take it slow and give me treats I will be their best friend. When Iâm let out of my box I get the zoomies sometimes and I LOVE to play with toys.

Describe your perfect day:
Waking up to a big breakfast and taking a long walk with my owner. When we get home, I would love to have a chew toy, and some snuggle time. If itâs sunny outside, lay outside and work on my tan for a while. At dinner I would love to sit at my ownersâ feet while they eat together as a family and then snuggle up in bed with them at the end of the night.

What is your favorite toy?
I love lots of toys if you play with me!

Do you know any tricks?
I know a lot! Sit, Stay, Down, 360. My foster family says Iâm really smart

What scares you?
New people that come up to me too quick and water.

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
Kids are cool, I donât mind them at all. My foster family has a 1 year old and I hang out on the couch with him and my foster fam.

Do you like cats?
Not so much

How do you feel about other dogs?
I would do best as an only dog in the house

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?
Finally with my forever family

How is your health?
My health is great now! I had a few minor problems; NorCal Bully Breed was amazing and got them all fixed!

Who do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion?
I live with three resident dogs, my foster mom, my foster dad and my one-year old foster brother. I love my foster mom the most because she snuggles me.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
Obviously in my house! My foster parents call it my crate

Where do you sleep?
In my crate

Do you like walking on a leash?
I LOVE walking on a leash, sometimes I get really excited and pull but a pinch collar works great to keep me in line since Iâm so strong.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? 
I do fence fight if a dog on the other side starts it. I donât initiate anything though.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside)
My foster parents have tile flooring and I havenât had any accidents

Do you like water?
Not really, I will tolerate a bath, but prefer to be dirty

What do you love about your foster family?
I love them because they understand me and keep me safe. They donât have a lot of people come and go which is really nice for me, as Iâm a little fearful of new people.

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue?
Well I was dumped on a riverbank and had just had puppies. Then I lived outside for a few years through all of the seasons which was hard because I didnât have a lot of human interaction.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Honey's adoption donation is $200.

Interested in meeting Honey or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

Benji is a 3-1/2 year old sweetheart whose favorite things are pets (boy does he love pets), treats, going on walks, runs and chases, and his favorite red ball. He loves water but hates baths. Benji isnât a fan of having his paws touched, so we make sure to walk him frequently to avoid having to get his nails trimmed. When going on walks, he should always be on leash, heâs a little too interested in exploring. Benji could use some leash training, but does really well not pulling when he has his harness on. Squirrels and birds are really fun for him on walks, he loves to chase them. 

Benji loves other dogs and cats but hasnât been socialized well so he may be overexcited at first, but with a proper introduction, he settles quickly. He has done well around kids, but may be overwhelming to him at first. 

Benji has had issues with separation anxiety and would do best with a family that is willing to work with him on that. He would love to have a stay at home parent since he is happiest with his people close to him .

Benji is such a lover and adores any attention youâre able to give to him. He will return that love with the upmost loyalty. His perfect day just might consist of a good bowl of kibble, a run outside with some pup friends, and endless pets from his people.

Gaby is friendly with people of all ages and would be appropriate for very young children due to his calm nature. (Yes, he takes treats gently from hand.)

Gaby is great with other dogs and very playful with select dogs. His foster caretaker has four other dogs and Gaby rough houses constantly with the one female dog. However,  Gaby does prefer hanging out w/ his foster caretaker. See a video of Gaby interacting with  a few other dogs at GSRSV's rescue ranch elsewhere on this page.

We have not seen Gaby around cats but my hunch is that he'd be OK with them. We'll consider a home with cats for Gaby.

Gaby is fully housetrained and very well-behaved inside. He's never had an accident indoors even though it's likely he was kept as an outside dog previously. Gaby does not know  even the \""sit\"" command, but I was able to get him to sit in just a minute or so with a biscuit as incentive. Oh--Gaby loves treats, so he'll likely be very easy to train. 

Gaby is good on leash and has great recall off-leash. He does not wander far when off-leash. He rides well in a car; in fact, Gaby LOVES to go for car rides!  

Gaby showed up at an RV park/marina along the Sacramento River in June. All efforts to find his owner failed so the man who found him (a friend of GSRSV's) offered to foster him until we could find him a home.

Gaby is located in Verona (small town along the Sacramento River in south Sutter County). His adoption fee is $210."

		Cork is a unique looking brown long coat male, approximately 3 years old, with one adorable floppy ear.  He was a stray from a local shelter, so no information is known about his past.  From his appearance, he looked liked he'd been on the streets for some time before landing in the shelter.

		In his first foster home, Cork enjoyed playing with the other female German Shepherd who was close to his age.  He is now in a home with another German Shepherd and a terrier mix. When not playing with the terrier he actively seeks out places to lay where it's cool, ie, soft dirt behind bushes.  He will sometimes come when called but not consistently, but usually a food prompt is enough to get him to come. However, when you call him (and he listens) he looks fantastic as he gallops across the yard. He has a very healthy prey drive (squirrels on the fence) so we are uncertain if he could live in a home with cats or small critters.

		He is a great big goofy dog and can be pretty affectionate, but only on his terms. He now allows being brushed.  He is a bit stand-offish and has very little in the way of training and doesn't respond quickly to the basic commands, although has learned to sit before getting fed. He is very food driven and protective of his feeding area. He will allow people to remove his bowl with no issues, but should be fed away from other animals.

		Cork loves wading in the water when taken to Nimbus Lake.  He startles easily whenever a bicycle comes up from behind him.  With time and consistent attention, he will be a fantastic friend and companion for a lucky family. 

		Cork limps occasionally on his right front leg.  X-rays revealed advanced osteo-arthritis in both elbows and his right elbow is more severe from what appears to be an old fracture.  Anti-inflammatories are needed at times to keep Cork comfortable.

This dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.

For more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. 

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State.

Annie

How old are you? About a year old

How much do you weigh?
I'm a little girl and weigh about 45 pounds.

What do you look like?
I have tan and white fur, with gorgeous black around both of my eyes, and black lipstick around my mouth that accentuates my beautiful smile. My foster mom tells me that I'm the most beautiful little pittie girl.

What do you like to eat?
Food really isn't my favorite thing but I really enjoy watermelon and a little bit of cheese sometimes.

What kind of personality do you have?
I'm very playful and have lots of energy! I'm friendly and love attention from people. I love to play and play and play with my foster dog brother. When it's quiet time, I'm a lover: my favorite place to be when I'm sleepy is snuggled in a lap or cuddled super close to my foster mom on the couch.

Describe your perfect day:
My perfect day would be spent outdoors: I love exploring and running and napping in the sun. I'd play with my forever family.

What is your favorite toy?
My favorite toys make squeaky noises, so I try really hard to get to whatever is making the noise to find out what it is. I really love harder toys that I can chew on for a long time.

Do you know any tricks?
Iâm very smart! My foster mom & dad are working on basic obedience right now (sit, stay, come, and telling me to get on my bed), and when I understand all of those, they said that they'll teach me how to shake, and more fun things.

What scares you?
I'm brave and not afraid of much. But Iâm not too fond of the hose... And the Roomba kinda scares me so I make sure to yell at it to get away from my foster family.

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I've only been around children one time and I was okay with them. I think that I'd be better with bigger kids though because I have so much energy.

Do you like cats?
I haven't met a cat yet so I don't know if I'd like them.

How do you feel about other dogs?
I love my foster dog brother because he's so easy-going and lets me do whatever I want. I don't know if I'd get along with another dog that would try to boss me around.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?
Running in a open field on a sunny day, with the wind at my back and a bone in my mouth.

How is your health?
The vet said that I'm a super healthy little girl!

Who do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion?
I live with my foster mom, dad, and foster dog brother. My foster mom is definitely my favorite but I also really like my foster-dad.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
I have a nice big comfy crate.

Where do you sleep?
I'll either sleep in my big crate or sometimes my foster mom lets me hog the bed.

Do you like walking on a leash?
I'm learning how to walk like a lady on leash. My foster mom and dad are teaching me to heel on their left side and I'm even learning that I need to sit every time that they stop walking.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? I like to hide shoes... I've even been tempted to chew on my foster mom's slippers and heels... She's learned now that she has to keep her shoes put away so I don't get tempted again.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside)
Since I'm still a young girl, I sometimes have potty accidents in the house if I've been playing for too long and my foster mom and dad aren't paying attention to let me go outside. I'm learning though that I need to go to the door to let them know that I have to potty.

Do you like water?
I don't seem to mind the sprinklers and getting wet, but the hose water kinda scares me.

What do you love about your foster family?
I love that they include me in everything that they do. They take me on walks and car rides (I LOVE to hang out of the window!) and they talk to me while they're working around the house. And I really love my foster dog brother!

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue?
I don't really remember... I met my foster mom and dad when I was walking down the street one day and they made sure that I had a safe place to stay waiting for my forever home to find me.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Annie's adoption donation is $200.

Interested in meeting Annie or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 2-4 business days."

He was tagged as a bite dog at 6 months old, we aren't sure that was the case and rather just a mouthy GSD puppy. We went out with one of our trainers and he is the only one their personal test dog wanted to play with. He passed our evaluations and his fosters who is also a trainer. He is potty trained, has been around children and people without any issues. We do not know how he is with cats but are happy to test with your resident cat after the application approval. 

Remi is up to date on his shots, is neutered and microchipped. The adoption fee is $350. We adopt in El Dorado County/surrounding counties. Unfortunately, we DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF STATE EXCEPT FOR RENO (also surrounding areas to Reno within 30 minutes).

He is about 4 years old and  weighs 47# which is a great size for a Pit.  He has beautiful markings and a muscular, athletic build.  

Mosely is an energetic, healthy boy.  He is  strong and  staff and volunteers are working on his leash manners so that he walks nicely without pulling. 

 He is people oriented and friendly.  He pays attention and is trying to understand what it takes to fit in.

Because he is a two year old, he gets wound up like a little kid,  so he needs consistent and patient training to become an obedient guy with nice manners who respects othersâ personal space.   He is super smart and very receptive to correction.  He makes strong attachments to people as he tries to find his forever owner.  
It would be great if Mosely continues with obedience training to learn what it takes to become a member of a family and not the boss!
He is sharp and wants to please and already knows how to sit.  

Mosleyâs attitude towards cats is somewhere between does not accept and OK with certain cats.  
We always recommend careful and proper introductions with other household animals.   
He is OK with dogs after proper introductions.

Mosley has much to offer a savvy, experienced dog owner or  family who will understand that he is still a youth. He is a sweetheart and all the energy put into him will be rewarded with a fun, loyal, wonderful companion.

Mosley is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

MOSELY can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center 
11232 B Avenue, Auburn, CA 95603

Shelter hours:
Monday - Saturday: 10:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Adoptions end at 4:30 p.m.)

		Judah is a very handsome 5 to 6-year-old, all white long coat male weighing about 70 lbs. He was surrendered to a shelter along with Spark, Havanna and another male when the original owner lost his home. Judah is possibly the sire of the other three white dogs. The previous owner indicates Judah had been an outdoor only dog. 

		He is one very, very sweet and nice boy! He walks well on a leash, is crate trained (he really doesn't like it) and learned the use of the doggy door within minutes of showing him where it was. As with the others that were surrendered with him, Judah craves human attention but is not obnoxious about it. He has learned that indoor living is the best and has learned to have impeccable house manners. Also, Judah loves to swim and fetch sticks and balls thrown in the lake.

		Judah is very smart and can be a bit pushy/bossy with other large dogs, but has blended in well with his foster pack of three other German Shepherds. He has been to play dates with a mix of large and small dogs and acted appropriately when meeting them and playing with them.

		He is not a dog for the first time German Shepherd owner, but will excel at being a loyal and loving companion to a family that knows the breed and is able to provide leadership, structure, exercise and guidance. Judah has moderate energy and is satisfied by daily walks of about 2 miles. 

		When Judah arrived at his foster home, his foster dad noticed that his left back leg turned in towards his body a little bit. When he was neutered, we x-rayed his hips and found that he has hip dysplasia. We are in the process of getting him vetted, to determine the best couse of action to correct the hip dysplasia. He does not seem to be uncomfortable or in pain, probably because he has had this condition his whole life.

		If you're looking for a well-mannered, sweet, gorgeous white long coat and have experience with GSDs, you should snatch this boy up before his foster dad keeps him! Please adopt him as I really don't need four dogs!!!!!

This dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.

For more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. 

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service.

		Zelda is a high energy, spirited, happy, sweet girl about 3 or 4 years old. She is not a dog for a first-time owner but would be a great addition for a family with German Shepherd or similar breed experience who understands the need for structure, leadership, and training.
		
		Zelda gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home but you won't have squirrels or cats in your yard if she has her way. She is missing some front teeth but recently had her dental issues taken care of. Now she is ready to find someone with the dedication to direct her energy in a positive way.

Darla

How old are you?

My foster mom thinks Iâm a pit bull/ mastiff, I'm a big girl, with just as big a heart!

How much do you weigh? 
75 pounds (Iâve gotten a bit too chunky so I'm on a diet)

What do you like to eat? 
A mix of grain free and non-grain free dog food.

I am a pretty lazy girl. I like to lay in my crate, and lay next to my foster mom. Maybe take a stroll around the neighborhood. Iâm a happy girl and like to politely meet people.

Describe your perfect day? 
Binge watching the latest murder mystery on Hulu with a forever best friend. Maybe take a break to lay in the sun. Food and treats.

What is your favorite toy? 
I have a chew bone i like to chew. Iâd rather snuggle.

I don't mind other dogs, I can take or leave them. I spend a lot of time with my foster brother (a small excuse of a dog) he's fine but I donât have unsupervised time with him or other dogs.

Do you like cats?
Maybe too much, I would do best in a home without cats.

If you could be anywhere in the world where would it be? 
In the air conditioning, being lazy, knowing I have a furever home

How is your health? 
The vet has given me a bill of good health.

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? 
My foster mom, her small resident dog, and a cat (mom keeps us separated since Iâm very interested in him). Foster mom is the best. She gives me lots of snuggles and love.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
I am alone quite a bit when mom is at work. I stay in the kitchen area of the home (mom has it sectioned off for me, and I sleep in my crate /kennel 99% of that time.

Where do you sleep? 
In my crate/kennel.

Do you like walking on a leash? 
The people who had me before didnât teach me any leash manners. Foster mom is working on training me to walk at heel but Iâm a bit of a tug boat. I do like going for walks but Iâm also happy just sleeping all day.

Do you have any not so great habits? 
Iâm still working on getting better at all the good dog habits of sit, wait, stay, etc. I am very willing just need consistency.

Are you house trained? 
Yes! Iâve never had a accident even when foster mom has a long work day.

Do you like water? 
I donât mind getting hosed down for a bath or playing in the kiddie pool but I donât think I would be a good swimmer.

What do you love about your foster family? 
Snuggles, food, and love.

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? 
I ended up in the shelter on death row but the shelter staff fought for me because they saw how sweet I was and then NBBR came to rescue me! Now Iâm ready for a family of my own.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Darla's adoption donation is $200.

Update: to our great sadness, Ginger has been diagnosed with probable cancer. She could still live 6 mo iot more. Her robust strength is going to help her thrive for awhile. 
We still would like to find her a family to love and love her. She is in great spirits.
Expenses will be covered. You only need to add love and a comfy atmosphere.



Senior LOVELY Staffy mix girl
67 lbs


Ginger was born in 2010. She is just the nicest, calmest, wonderful gal.
Ginger loves dogs, cats, children, walks, traveling in the car.
She knows lots of commands and always wants to please. Lives to meet new people. She would be a great shop dog or just a wonderful companion for anyone who loves a good solid dog.

This girl has so many good years ahead of her. Hoping someone will see her beauty and be proud to stand beside her. She is a very young senior, still in touch with her â inner puppy.â

Ginger was abandoned and just hung out for 2 months making herself comfortable on peoples porches and lawns. Never one to complain, she made the best of a bad situation. She finally caught out attention and we went and picked her up.
Spayed, shots and good teeth.

If you think Ginger would make a good addition to your family, email me at caindenises@gmail.com or call 530-955-5111.

Hi, I am an 8-year-old chi, 7 pounds. I was rescued from a hoarding situation and I had 7 mammary tumors removed and dental done. I have separation anxiety so I need someone who will be with me most of the time. I am very affectionate and good with cats and dogs.

Meet sweet boy Frankie!  He is such a handsome mix weighing 52 lbs. Frankie is a sweet playful boy who knows sit, shake, and down. He LOVES playing with other dogs so a home with a playmate for Frankie would be great. 
A home without cats is needed since Frankie is a little too interested in them.
We are not positive on his breed. He may be a mix of husky, akita and chow.
He is very friendly and has been fine with kids ages 11 and up.

Frankie is a smart boy that learns quickly. He is house trained, rides great in the car, loves to be with people and around 2 years old. He is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated and ready for his new forever home.  He is located in Sacramento. If you are interested in meeting him you can submit an application at:

He's around 60 lbs which is a great size for a household. Nigel found himself at the shelter after his family abandoned him when they got a new puppy. Nigel was shut down at the shelter and extremely sad so we gave him a second chance at life. He's in a foster home getting the love and care he deserves but he needs a loving forever home immediately. He loves people and will give you all the snuggles you can possibly need and he is a great companion animal. It's pretty hard to resist his smooshy bulldog face and he seems to know this by smiling up at you luring you in! Nigel is fun but moderate to low energy, making him ideal for someone who is not super active or just prefers to stay home. He's is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, heart worm negative and house and crate trained. 

Child appropriate? Nigel would do best with older children, probably 10 and up, who could enjoy playing with him. He can get excited when playing so smaller kids might be too much for him. 

Other dog appropriate? Nigel does not react to dogs at all when walking by them or seeing them but he has shown some negative behaviors if allowed to play or interact. We feel he would be best as the only pet in the home.

Cat appropriate? Absolutely NO kitties for Nigel.

How is he with strangers? Nigel has done fine meeting strangers and seems happy to see people. 

What is his play style? When playing with people he can get a little excited and jumpy or start to hump but other than that he likes to fetch a ball and play tug. He tires out fast so he does not need a lot of high energy play to wear him out. 

Does he like toys? Nigel seems to enjoy nylabone toys for chewing and he likes tug toys. He will play with stuffy toys but loses interest more quickly with them.

Does he like water? Nigel does not seem to be a fan of water. He seems afraid of the hose and will not go in the pool. He would not likely make a good lake dog!

Does he like car rides? Nigel loves car rides and he rides very well. He's calm and sits on the seat and enjoys looking out at his surroundings.

Exercise level needed? Nigel wears out pretty fast from activity so a neighborhood walk or some ball time in the yard is about all he needs. He can overheat easily during hot weather as bulldogs often can. He's an easy dog to have in terms of exercise because he doesn't need to be taken for a long run or anything to get his energy out. 

Behavior issues? Nigel can be frightened by loud noises so he needs to be contained during thunder storms or when fire works occur. He can also be afraid of big trucks or fast moving objects. This is not a behavior issue but is worth noting. When stressed or overexcited he will hump, which is not an appealing behavior but he does respond to a firm \""No\"" when redirected to stop. Sometimes he needs to hear it several times but will stop. We do believe that after being given enough time to adjust in a home, this behavior will minimize. Humping is often a sign of stress for a dog and poor Nigel has had a lot of stress in his life and he needs stability.

Medical issues? Nigel has no known medical issues.
?
Skills? Nigel knows how to sit, lay down, shake and roll over. He's a smart cookie and learns fast!   

Special/endearing things? Nigel is a very sweet, attentive boy. He enjoys back scratches and snuggles and being as close as possible. He is what we often call \""velcro dogs\"" dogs who are just drawn to people and prefer being nearby at all times. He's curious and will follow you throughout the home so you'll never be lonely! Nigel's adorable underbite will melt your heart when he stairs up at you and offers you his paw. He's a super smarty and he learns quickly so if you're looking for a dog you can have fun with obedience skills, Nigel would be perfect! Nigel had a home for the first five years of his life that was not ideal for him. He did not receive the care he deserved and then he was dumped at the shelter. He was extremely sad and wondering where his family went so it would be great to get him back into a home where he can get and give the love he so very much wants and deserves.

Ideal home? The ideal home for Nigel would be one where he has a big back yard with a solid wood fence where he can run and play and be a dog. Nigel never had that growing up and was contained to a tiny yard or in the house and that is no life for a large dog. He likes to lay in the grass and relax and having a nice big back yard would be great for him. His home needs to be other pet free as he prefers to be the star of the show. A home where he can get a lot of love and be a true member of the family, being allowed to live inside, snuggle on the couch, sleep in his caregivers room, things like that. He loves people and loves being close and would really enjoy a family who includes him. A caregiver who works from home would be awesome for him as he doesn't love being alone. The ideal home would be one on the quieter side because Nigel can be scared of loud noises and activity. Lastly, he would prefer to stay home or go on car rides vs. going into public places and being taken everywhere. That kind of lifestyle would be too stressful for him so someone content to let Nigel kick it at home most of the time would be great :)"

Are you a little slow to warm to new people? Tired of this fast paced crazy world? Koenig might be your spirit animal! Read on below to learn more about Koenig and how to apply to adopt your next BFF ?

What is your name? Koenig (which means King)

How old are you? About 1.5 years old

How much do you weigh? Roughly 60lbs

What do you look like? I am beautiful! My fur is light caramel color and my eyes are a light hazel. I am not too big or small.

What kind of personality do you have? I take a while to warm up to new people. I can be very particular! If you have a lot of people coming to visit or you are constantly on the go, I am NOT the dog for you. A quiet stable environment would be the healthiest place for me. Once I like someone I am a great companion, I just need time!

Describe your perfect day. Probably playing with other dogs and having lots of snacks.

What is your favorite toy? All of them!

Do you know any tricks? I know basic commands like sit, but can still learn!

What scares you? New people, but nothing else in general.

Have you been around children, do you like them? I would do best in an all adult home.

Do you like cats? Cats? No thanks. I would probably chase them.

How do you feel about other dogs? I like them! I get along with all the dogs in my current place.

If you could be anywhere in the world where would it be? A nice yard would be pretty cool.

How is your health? I am very healthy!

Do you like walking on a leash? I can walk well but would take a lot of practice and a strong leader to get me into outside walks since I am afraid of new people. It might be more fun for me to play ball in a yard or play with other dogs in my backyard.

Do you have any not so great habits that we should know about for instance do you bark or dig in the yard? Outside of my fear of new people not really.

Are you house trained? Yes, I sure am.

Do you like water? Sure I do!

What do you love about your current family? I have been in temporary housing for a little while. It is ok because I get food, play time and a bed, the people here take good care of me but it isnât a home.

What was your life like before being rescued by your current family? I am crashing at a kennel for now. My first home had a combined family and they were unable to manage my special needs with theirs. The place where I have been taken when my owners were out of town knew I deserved a chance so while I wasnât the right fit for my prior family I deserve a home with the right person!

Hi my name is Cuddles. I am a 5-year-old, 10 pounds terrier mix. I was rescued by Scooters as a part of a hoarding case. I suffered traumatic injury to my lower jaw months ago and because the injury was not treated in time now the vet says my jaw cannot be repaired. But all this doesnât stop me from being a happy normal dog. I eat normally. I like my food to be a bit wet so itâs easier for me to eat it using my tongue. I like to drink lots of water. I love to cuddle in bed and play with other dogs so having another playful dog is a must for me. I am super friendly. Scooters got me a dental. The vet took out all my rotted teeth and repaired my nasal passage so that food doesnât get stuck in it. I am looking for a special person who will adopt me and love me forever so I forget all that I have been through. If you are that person please fill out an adoption application"

Have you been around children? No I havenât while in my foster momâs house

Do you like cats?
my foster mom says itâs best that I donât live with cats.

How do you feel about other dogs? 
Other dogs are great. I havenât met one I didnât like ?

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be ?
With you where ever you go.

How is your health?
Iâm in great shape. My foster mom has taken good care of me. Iâm at the perfect weight and have nice soft hair.

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? 
My foster family consists of my foster mom, my foster fur sister and fur brother. I love being with them all.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
In my very own bedroom.

Where do you sleep?
In my open crate in my foster momâs room

Do you like walking on a leash? 
Oh yes! Iâm very good on a leash Iâve been told. I never pull and stay right next to you.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? 
Nope, but I will alert bark when I sense you need to know something is going on.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside): Absolutely! 
I go potty outside before my foster mom leaves for work and again when she gets home and before we all go to bed. Iâm good and never potty in my room or in my crate. Once my foster my is home I do come and go as I please through this thing called a dog door my foster mom has and itâs amazing!

Do you like playing in water? 
Yes! I love to go to the lake and we have a kiddy pool in the backyard too.

What do you love about your foster family? 
I love that my foster mom has been patient with me while I learned the rules of the house. I feel happy and safe there. My fur brother and fur sister are fun to have around too.

What was your life like before being joining NBBR?
I was found in a cemetery after I had 7 babies. I was so skinny and hungry when I came to live with my foster mom. Now Iâm healthy, happy and looking forward to the future with you.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread throughout the Sacramento area. We require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog and the home. This allows us to complete a yard check to guarantee the applicant's yard is secure, and have the dog close enough should any behavioral issues arise. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather based on what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary).

Stella's adoption donation is $200

Interested in meeting Stella or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

Little Buddy has had a rough start, he was found roaming the streets of LA starving and dirty.  A kind individual was able to pick him up and bring them to a local shelter.

He sat in the shelter for a very long time since he was extremely afraid of people and did not trust anyone.

We rescued him and have been helping him blossom into a darling little munchkin.  He can still be a little shy but he has come a very long way.

He does well with older children and most dogs big and small.  The BEST home for him to thrive in would be a very quiet environment with stay at home person.

If you have a big heart for a beautiful little guy that needs tic then Buddy could be the perfect fit.

Buddy 

7 years old 
Neutered 
Up to date on shots 

Potty trained 
Good on a leash

Good with older children 
Good with most dogs (large and small)

Franco

Franco is a friendly, attentive, strong, handsome, and intelligent 6 year old Pit Bull Terrier male.  It is evident that he has had  prior training because he knows basic commands as well as some cute tricks, including how to sit, lie down, stay, rollover, shake, play âbang, youâre deadâ and DOUBLE high five.   He also walks pretty nicely on a leash for a big, strong dog. 

Franco is in great physical shape.  Francoâs coat is a rich silver gray (with a small splash of white on his chest) and he weighs 66#.  Franco will need a life full of  a medium level activities; he is muscular and athletic. Because he is 6 years old, he qualifies for our Senior for Seniors program where adopters over 55 y/o have his adoption fee waived.

Franco is outgoing and confident. He likes to be petted and he likes to be with people.  He is very affectionate and friendly and wants to be your pal.  
He is receptive and sensitive to correction. Staff and volunteers are working with him on all of his doggie manners. He is very gentle. He wants to be loved and express his love for you. 

He likes to chill cuddled up next to your side.  He likes to be close.  He is very bright and tries to please and be responsive to what is expected of him.  He is a quality dog and an absolute keeper!   

Franco is okay with certain dogs and is selective and can be a little pushy, so proper introductions would be important.  He appears to respect cats and  is OK with cats after proper introductions.

Franco shows every indication of being a devoted companion and loyal best friend. He likes toys and knows how to play fetch.  Are you that special person for him to belong to and make a fun, wonderful life with? Come down and meet him. You will not be disappointed by this wonderful dog.

Franco is neutered, microchipped, hw tested negative, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives. 

Franco can be seen at the Placer County Animal Services Center

Nine is just a number for her. Happy Tails came to her rescue after being surrendered to the shelter by her previous people. She was depressed in the kennels there and was not available for adoption because of it. Once she was in her foster home she blossomed into a very sweet and loving dog almost immediately. It was magic! She potty trained and takes direction well. She loves long walks, but is also comfortable cuddling up with you on the sofa. She would do equally well in a home with a lot of activity or in a quiet setting. She loves to be with her people and does not like to be alone at night. She will need to be placed in a home that will not crate her overnight. She will do best in a home without other pets â especially cats â and does not mind being alone during the day.

These are just some of the adjectives that my Foster person uses to describe my personality! Hi, my name is Toby. Iâm a 110 lb, gentle giant with soulful brown eyes and a disposition to match. I have a beautiful, thick tricolor coat. Just some of my great qualities include walking on a loose leash, housetrained, crate-trained and well-mannered with all people I meet. I would do best in a home with older children. My ideal home would be quiet and slightly active. You see, I was rescued from Yolo County Shelter by the wonderful volunteers at EDCGSR. They heard I needed double elbow surgery, so they invested in me and provided the care I needed. I am on the mend and showing my personality! Iâm somewhat interested in other dogs, but have a high interest in little animals, so cats are probably a no. My Foster mom says I have an excellent nose and love to sniff every inch of my surroundings. My ideal furever home would be with someone who is home most of the day and enjoys hanging around a quiet home. If youâre looking for a sweet and gentle spirit who will devote his life to giving you love and affection, then reach out and meet me.

Raspberry

How old are you? About 2 years old

How much do you weigh? About 55 lbs

What do you look like? Iâm a beautiful girl with the prettiest brown fur and a white chest. I also have a white spot the the top of my head.

What do you like to eat? For breakfast and dinner I eat Taste of the Wild With salmon. But, I really like treats and anything with peanut butter.

What kind of personality do you have? I have a good amount of energy and LOVE to play. But my foster mom does tell me Iâm the sweetest girl and I love climbing into someoneâs lap and getting all the love.

Describe your perfect day: My perfect day would start with playing in the yard and then Iâd come in for breakfast. After that Iâd like to play some more, maybe take a nap and then wake up and play some more!

What is your favorite toy? I love toys! My foster mom has this thing called a flirt pole and itâs my favorite! But really I love all toys but I donât like to share them.

Do you know any tricks? I can sit, lay down and shake. Iâm also learning this thing called Wait

What scares you? Nothing really, Iâm very brave!

Have you been around children? Do you like them? I love kids but my foster mom thinks I should be in a house with bigger kids because sometimes I get excited and jump on people

Do you like cats? I love to stalk them! But I should probably be in a home without cats

How do you feel about other dogs? I love to play with other dogs after proper introductions of course, but I donât like to share my toys so toy-free playtime is best when thereâs another dog to play with.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? Iâd love to be outdoors playing with my forever family

How is your health? When my foster mom got me from the shelter my ear was so infected that it was completely swollen shut. My foster mom has taken great care of me and with the guidance and medication from an amazing vet.... my ear is better. I will need allergy medication and my ear flushed once a week but Iâm totally worth it!!

Who do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion? I live with my foster mom and two little girls. I also have 2 foster dog brothers and 2 cats that live here.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? I stay in my crate when no one is home

Where do you sleep? I sleep in my crate, itâs comfy in there

Do you like walking on a leash? I really love going for walks. I have a special collar I wear and as soon as I see my foster mom grab it, I get really excited!

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? Sometimes I get really excited and jump on people, Iâm working really hard on that but I just get so excited. Another bad habit I have is I am obsessed with the cats that I live with, really obsessed,stalk them obsessed. Iâm also working on not yelling at other dogs I see, but I just get so excited

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) Yes!

Do you like water? Iâm not really sure about water but I do like warm baths

What do you love about your foster family? I love that they give me attention and treats, lots of treats! Also my foster mom sings âRaspberry the Dogâ to me in the tune of Princeâs Raspberry Beret (sheâs weird but I like it).

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? I was at the shelter with a bad ear infection but as soon as I got to my foster home they took care of me and got the help I needed to get my ear to heal and now Iâm ready to find my forever home.

*NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions.

He needs daily eye medications, but lives a happy, healthy life--just like any other dog!  His eyes have improved but, he will still need daily eye drops.

She has a protective nature and is outgoing.  You can talk her out of most things fairly easily and enjoys spending lots of time outside.  She enjoys attention and is very sweet.

1578,44606845,CA2336,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/ginger-44606845/ca/auburn/one-by-one-rescue-project-ca2336/?referrer_id=9825d0c8-29d4-4feb-9841-e9bfcd37fd1b,Dog,American Staffordshire Terrier,,TRUE,FALSE,Red / Chestnut / Orange,White / Cream,,Adult,Female,Large,Short,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Ginger,adoptable,2019-05-03T19:05:19+0000,Auburn,CA,95603,US,89423,9/20/2019,"Ginger is around 4 years old and is currently in a foster home. Ginger is a super sweet girl who needs an active home who will play with her and appreciate her playfulness and zest for life. She is extremely loving and really bonds with her people. Ginger has been through obedience training and has really learned a lot and needs a family who will continue to help her practice her manners. She does well when left alone in the house and is used to having a dog door to the back yard. She really enjoys snuggling on the couch and spending time with people. She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, crate trained, house trained and microchipped. 

Child appropriate?  Ginger has loved all the kids she has met so far. She greets everyone very happily but can get a bit overexcited and will jump on children because she is excited to play.  She has been great with the 8-9 year olds in fosters old neighborhood. Older children that can play tug of war would be best as Ginger loves to tug!

Other dog appropriate? While Ginger has not had a ton of dog exposure in her foster home, she has played well with other dogs around her size. She has not been around small dogs to play with and we would not recommend a small dog as Ginger likes to play and her size might be intimidating for a small dog. Ginger would enjoy the company of another friendly, medium energy dog who likes to play.

Cat appropriate? Most likely not. She has not been in a house with a cat and the neighbor cat would tease her while on top of the fence. 

How is she with strangers? She loves people and is friendly with everyone she has met.  She wants attention from people. 

What is her play style?  With people she loves to play tug of war with a rope or toy that is big enough. That seems to be her favorite game and enjoys someone strong enough to give her a good, honest tug!  With other dogs, she likes to run and chase but does not appear to enjoy super rough and tumble play from another dog.

Does she like toys? She loves toys. She chews up stuffed toys and carries them around. She does not chew shoes or slippers. She likes sturdy balls and squeak toys.

Does she like water? Ginger seems to do ok with water but prefers to wade around vs. jump in. She has not had a kiddy pool so we aren't sure about those but she might enjoy one.

Does she like car rides? She loves riding in the car and sits nicely when riding. She pretty much just enjoys being with people so being in a car puts her right where she wants to be!

Exercise level needed?  Ginger loves to  run in the yard and would enjoy some yard playtime with her human family or another dog. Her favorite pastime is playing tug of war to get some energy out. She is medium energy so will need daily exercise of yard play time or brisk walk/run. She will chase a toy  or ball and bring it back but not always drop it for fetch.

Behavior issues? She gets very excited when people come to the house and will still jump on them to get attention until they pet her.  She can also be pushy with wanting attention. She only barks when someone is in the yard or at the front door. She will obey when told to stop when it is other dogs next door.  She likes to lick but will stop when asked to do so. Ginger can get overstimulated when out in public, excited to see other dogs, sometimes people, and this can impact her leash walking. She needs more exposure to the world to curb this excitement and a family who can be patient with her. 

Medical issues? She has \""Happy tail Syndrome\"". She wags her tail so hard it can split from hitting something hard. 

Skills? She waits to get on the couch or bed until given permission to do so.  She sits and waits for permission. She can sit, shake and sometimes lay down.  She can wait  and stay if she is not over excited by a person at the door.  She wants to have the attention.     

Special/endearing things? She sits upright beside her foster mom on the couch and watches T.V.  She likes to snuggle.  She puts her paw or head on you. She wiggles her butt while wagging her tail when she is excited to see humans.

Ideal home?  Ginger's ideal home would be with adults and some older kids that can play tug of war with her or adults that have time to play with her. An active home would be best because she is still young and energetic. Another dog that is similar in energy and play style would be nice for her. She likes to sleep with her human on the bed so a home who will allow her to be a true member of the family, couch time, etc...would be ideal.  Ginger would need a fenced back yard where she can run around and play.

Looking for a best friend that can go everywhere with you? A snuggly confidant that will love you back every moment of every day? Quiet, but playful, good traveler, and will accept your friends and family instantly? Smart little gal who listens? Here she is!!!!!!

Hi! 
My name is Luna. I am 6 years young, and I weigh 5.5 lbs. I am what you call a pure Chihuahua. I have an unusual soft rusty brown coat with white feet. I am sweet and loving, a great little snuggler at bedtime. I rarely bark, and am housebroken. 
You should also know that I am bold and brave with dogs and cats of all size. Don't underestimate me. I can chase a Rottweiler back to his bed if I need too! 
I was raised by my mom as an only dog, and love being your everything!  I am playful and like my toys. I like all people immediately. I'm being fostered with all size dogs and it's going well.
Sadly, my mom had some difficulties with housing, and thinks I need a more stable home. She loves me, and took very good care of me.

Home2home-nc on facebook is trying to help me find a new family. 
I am spayed, all shots and healthy. 
Are you my new family? Probably best there be no kids undee 12. I am not a toy, and tiny dogs can be at risk of injury with very small kids.

Please call my foster mom Denise at 530-955-5111 and lets talk!

Sasha Fierce!

How old are you? About two

How much do you weigh? A compact 50lbs

What do you look like? Have you seen me? I am gorgeous! I am short and stout and my brindle colors are fabulous.

What kind of personality do you have? I am a very sweet girl, I warm up to the ladies right away and by warm up I mean I am in your lap or at your feet whenever possible. I have lots of energy, and am playful and happy!

Describe your perfect day. Food, treats and lots of play time with my people or my dog friends. Maybe even a short run if you are up for it.

What is your favorite toy? All of them! Especially balls, I can entertain myself if I have a ball. I toss them up, and catch them and then roll them around, itâs pretty funny.

Do you know any tricks?
I do not know a ton of tricks yet, still working on it!

What scares you? I can be timid of new men but warm up pretty quick, just pet me and give me attention. On walks loud cars can freak me out a little, but I am fine after they pass.
Nothing else really scares meâ¦â¦not even that weird vacuum thing.

Have you been around children, do you like them?
I have been around some smaller kids I do pretty well, I still play nibble, which I am working on and improving daily and can be a little rambunctious so older kids would be best unless, the parents are around to make sure I donât knock the rugrats down!

Do you like cats? Cats? Not sureâ¦I do not react to them when on my walks so maybe with proper introductions.

How do you feel about other dogs? I like them A LOT, my favorite thing to do is play w/ my older pup brother. I leave my dogs sisters alone unless they want to play with me first. I would do well with a dog who likes to play!

If you could be anywhere in the world where would it be? Wherever my humans are, I love when they are around unless I have a playful dog to roll around with.

How is your health? I am in wonderful health!
Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion.
My foster humans, my foster dog brother and 2 two-foster dog sisters. Foster mom is my favorite, I sit right in her lap when I can, but Ralphie my foster pup brother is a close second. He lets me play wild with him.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? In my large crate with toys! This is a safe and cozy place! I whimper a little at first but settle down quickly. If I am an only dog I can probably just lounge on the couch while you are gone. I am not destructive and am potty trained.

Do you like walking on a leash? Foster mom says I excel at this, I walk without pulling and I run like a champ.

Do you have any not so great habits that we should know about for instance do you bark or dig in the yard?
I may bark a little at new men or be a little shy with new people at first. I dig in the dirt sometimes but not in the grass, thatâs good though right?

Are you house trained?
Yes! In fact, I have only had one accident in the house and itâs not really my fault I stood by the door but fosmom didnât make it in time. I tried to tell her!

Do you like water? 
Not sure, bath time is ok I guess.

What do you love about your current family? They give me so much love, hugs and kisses, I have lots of toys to keep me busy and I sure do enjoy another dog to play with. I also appreciate that they are patient as I grow into a mature pup! I have some things to learn still because of my life on the streets but I sure am sweet.

What was your life like before being rescued by your current family?
I donât like to talk much about it because the past is the past right? But I was likely a great companion to someone in Tijuana until I was attacked by a man with a machete, he hurt my head and back but luckily a kind person took me to a vet, I recovered and became a ârescueâ?....I even got to fly in a plane to Sacramento with Pilots N Paws to my new foster home, it was pretty cool. I have shut that door and moved on to my new fierce and fabulous life. I am healthy, happy and ready for a forever home, thanks to NorCal Bully Breed Rescue.

*NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks.

Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary).

Sasha's adoption donation is $200.

Interested in meeting Sasha or any of our available pooches? Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 2-4 business days.

Farah is your Girl!!

Through no fault of her own, sweet Farah spends her days alone in a backyard. Farah is currently in a rescue with many senior dogs where she doesn't exactly fit in because she has a bit more energy than her senior peers.

Farah is a spry and healthy 5-7 year old that loves people, going for walks and playing ball. Farah is very well behaved, walks great on leash and loves being around people! ?

Read more about Farah in her bio below!

What is your name?
Hello there! My name is Farah!

How old are you?
Thatâs a good questionâ¦.I was found as a stray and the shelter thinks I may be 7 years old.

How much do you weigh?
Psssttâ¦.are you supposed to ask ladies about their weight? Between you and me, I am a healthy 46lbs.

What do you look like?
Iâm a beauty! I am a tri-colored lady with a white beauty mark on my face. I have gorgeous brown eyes that draw you in and melt your heart. ?

What do you like to eat?
I enjoy dry grain free beef kibble.

What kind of personality do you have?
I am a sweet and loving girl that loves to go for walks and play ball. I LOVE belly rubs and being around people.? I am energetic, but not without manners; I know not to jump on people or behave like a spaz.

Describe your perfect day:
My perfect day would hands down be hanging with my human(s), going for a long walk or hike, getting some belly rubs and then just chillaxing.?

What is your favorite toy?
The ball is my #1 favorite toy!

Do you know any tricks?
I am very smart! I know how to open my crate and open doors with levers.

What scares you?
So far, I havenât found anything that frightens me.

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I havenât been around kids since Iâve been in the care of the rescue, but I did see kids (7/8 years old) at the park and they seemed kinda fun!

Do you like cats?
Honestly, I have not seen one since Iâve been in foster care, so Iâm not sure. But I can tell you that I love to chase squirrelsâ¦they are like furry balls!

How do you feel about other dogs?
I know for sure that I like well mannered big dogs, with a proper introduction of course!?

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?
I would be with my forever family enjoying life!?

How is your health?
I'm in great health!

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion?
Right now I am living at an in home rescue with other dogs and adults. Itâs not an ideal living situation for me. I am really sad and lonely all the time because I am by myself in the backyard all day.?

Where do you hang out when you are home alone?
I stay in the backyard by myself.?

Where do you sleep?
I sleep in my crate in the house.

Do you like walking on a leash?
I love to go for walks and I am a fantastic leash walker!

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?
Iâm a good girl. Iâm not a barker, digger or jump on people kinda dog.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside)
Of course! Potty is for outside only.

Do you like water?
Iâm not sure if I like to swim, but I know for sure that I like to drink water.

What do you love about your foster family?
They saved me from the shelter and are taking care of me while I find my forever family.

Hi my name is Gabriella. I am a 7 year old German Shepherd, 70 pounds that was dumped with my puppies at a high kill shelter. Another rescue came and took my puppies and decided not to take me as I tried to protect my puppies. I did not eat and cried for several days. Finally I heard the volunteers saying that Scooters was coming to pick me up. I was confused and scared I didnât know what that meant but I went with my foster mom. It took sometime for me to warm up to her but today I am healthy, happy and learning to trust people. I am good with cats but not good with other dogs. My foster mom has taught me a lot of commands and is working with my shyness. I am very laid back.

If you have a cozy bed for me, a TV, love and food please fill out an adoption application"

Cleo

How old are you?
My foster parents tell me I'm around six but I pretty dang spunky ?

How much do you weigh?
About 60 pounds

What do you look like?
My foster mom says I look like a land seal. I'm a pretty stinking cute low rider with a beautiful white and grey coat. My face is starting to go a little more white with age but it adds a level of sophistication.

What do you like to eat?
Oh my! I LOVE FOOD! I eat, well pretty much everything. My favorite treat that foster mom makes me is my Kong frozen with a peanut butter, banana and yogurt mixture! Yum-yum! Although for breakfast and dinner I'm eating Costcoâs beef and sweet potato dog food. ?

What kind of personality do you have?
Iâm pretty silly! I pretty much always have a goofy smile on my face! I hop and skip around when it's dinner or breakfast...did I mention I love food? Even though I'm not a puppy anymore I still have a lot of energy and I love to play with toys! And oh my I love love love walks! ?

Describe your perfect day:
Oh wow! My perfect day? Well it would start with some morning pets and kisses. Then I would take a nice long walk and come home to a good breakfast. Then I would jump up on the couch with my human and nap. After nap time a much needed play session would happen. Then an evening walk followed with dinner. I really just enjoy being with my people. ?

What is your favorite toy?
I love all of my toys and I like to play with them all at the same time! So much fun! Foster mom gets a bark box every month for me and my dog foster sister so I have a lot of toys! If I had to pick one it would be my squeaky ball! ?

Do you know any tricks?
I know sit! I sit really well when I see a treat! Foster mom is working on shake but I havenât figured that one out yet.

What scares you?
Not a whole lot! I like to follow the vacuum around while Mom is cleaning. It's fun watching her clean up after my toys!

Have you been around children? Do you like them?
I have not been around children. So I'm not sure how I would do.

Do you like cats?
They are pretty cool! They smell funny and are fun to chase. But if mom tells me to stop I will. (She is no fun). I like to groom the fat one. ?

How do you feel about other dogs?
They are okay. I get along with my foster sister but she let's me do my thing. I would probably prefer to be an only dog so I get all of the attention or, a dog that isnât really high energy because Iâm too old for that puppy nonsense.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?
With my human(s). I think I spent a lot of time alone so now I like to spend as much time as I can with my humans getting pets and cuddles.

How is your health?
Itâs pretty good! I do have a torn ligament on my back right leg but I get around amazing on it! In fact you can't even tell anything is wrong!

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion?
I live with my foster mom and dad and my foster uncle (he's pretty cool I love playing and laying with him). I also live with my dog foster sister and a bunch of cats! I'm not picky with who I'm with with as long as they give good pets.

Where do you hang out when youâre home alone?
In my crate.

Where do you sleep?
I have been spoiled and sleep in bed with my uncle but know how to sleep in my crate. ?

Do you like walking on a leash?
I think I'm new to walking on leash so I'm still learning manners. But I love walks!

Do you have any not-so-great habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?
I like to talk when I'm being ignored but mom tells me to stop and I do. Sometimes I bark at the squirrels! But hey they are teasing me! They keep telling me good girls don't put their dirty paws on clean tables. But I am a good girl so don't know what they are talking about. Although they have found a spray bottle works well for correcting my bad behavior!

Are you house trained?
Very much so, unless thereâs torrential flooding, lightening, hail and thunder outside.

Do you like water?
I love to drink it!! Bath time is okay.

What do you love about your foster family?
I love when they play with me! But I also love when they cuddle me and give me the best pets. But what I love most is how much they love me!

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue?
I was found wandering the streets of Oakland. Luckily I got picked up and taken to a shelter where my foster parents drove down to get me right before Thanksgiving! So you can only guess what I was thankful for that year! But I'm not looking back on my past I want to move forward and spend the rest of my life happy and with my forever family!

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home.

This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions.

We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog.

Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary).

Cleo's adoption donation is $200.

Interested in meeting Cleo or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 2-4 business days."

She is only about 18 inches off the floor, on all four paws, weighing in at 45 pounds. She is a bodybuilder extraordinaire with a bark to match. She is reserved and hesitant with strangers, likely due to mistreatment and abuse. When Grace was found, she was hiding out under a bush in an apartment complex. She was skin and bones and starving, all the while feeding an entire litter of puppies. However, that life is far behind her now, she is one of the happiest, kissiest dogs youâll ever meet! Gracie Lou is looking for a home with consistency. She needs people she can rely on, who will work with her and love her endlessly. She has been let down too many times and will require a very stable environment. She is safe at her foster home until the right person or family comes along to carry her off into the sunset.

After months on the adoption floor, Pongo was adopted, but returned within a week. He deteriorated in the shelter, and was at risk of being euthanized at any moment when he came to SacRDR. Pongo can take a bit to warm up to new people, but when given a little time and space to decide a new human is safe, his sweet, goofy personality comes through!

Scrambles

How old are you? 2 years old

Are you a boy or a girl? Iâm a manâs man ?

Do you know where your family came from (Breed question)? Iâm definitely a pit mix but no one knows what Iâm mixed with other than a unique blend of âBALL!â ? and âdonât bother me, I have things to do.â

How much do you weigh? 40lbs

What do you look like? I am DAMN handsome! I have honey colored fur with very distinguishing white patches. And you may have noticed my awesome ear.

What do you like to eat? Nutri Source

What kind of personality do you have? You know, I feel like I relate to cats really well, emotionally anyhow. Iâm only interested in affection every so often and Iâm definitely not super snuggly. Iâd rather be in the room with people than ON them so Iâm basically the definition of THE BEST ROOMMATE EVER. Unless you want to play with me and then itâs GAME ON! Otherwise, Iâm pretty happy just chilling out near my people.

Describe your perfect day? Iâm definitely a foodie but not the obnoxious, take 15 pictures of my food bowl and make the foster mom-person late for work kind of foodie. ? Point being, I really like breakfast and dinner and treats, not necessarily in that order. Throw in some play time outside with a few toys. Nap time is always great. Maybe a few pets and more time outside wishing I was a human rugby player.

What is your favorite toy? I am partial to the Nerf Tuff Tug X-Ring. Itâs a ball with stuffing, it doesnât get any better than that. ?

Do you know any tricks? I know how to be stubborn but not necessarily impossibly stubborn. For me, itâs more of a game of whoâs teaching who. I did learn to use my crate and sit though. But really, thatâs because Iâm a civilized dude, not because itâs a trick.

What scares you? The thought of a bunch of screaming tween girls trying to kiss me and dress me up for a Snapchat photo shoot. ? ? ?

Have you ever been around children? Yeah, I live with two 8 year olds. We have an understanding that Iâm âCool Uncle Scramblesâ. I give them pointers on sports, like how to play soccer-dodgeball (my own invention) and proper sprinting technique. ?

How do you feel about other dogs? The shrink at the rescue says that I lack social graces and because of my smaller size and neurological issues, another dog will probably open up a can of whoop ass on me for being clueless and wanting to play in all of the wrong ways. Itâs a mouthful, I know. No dog pals for me. ??

Do you like cats? Iâm not any better mannered with cats and I hear they can cause you to lose an eye or two so probably better that I not have to live with one. ?

If you could be anywhere in the world where would it be? In the yard playing.

How is your health? Itâs great. I have a weird issue with my brain where Iâll randomly fall over when I go on long walks or get overly excited. Iâve seen a neurologist. As long as Iâm not running marathons, Iâm fine. ?

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? I live with my foster mom-person, foster dad-person, two 8 year old-persons, and 2 resident mutts. Iâm closest to my foster mom-person. Sheâs big on manners and boundaries (eye roll). Even though sheâs a hardhead I can tell she digs me.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? In my crate/man cave.

Where do you sleep? Man cave.

Do you like walking on a leash? Iâm a pro. I like to go down the street and come right back. What can I say, I have good genes and I donât need all that cardio nonsense.

Do you have any not so great habits? I donât have any bad habits. Iâm just not your typical cuddly buddy.

Are you house trained? Gross, dude. Of course Iâm house trained. What kind of interview is this?

Do you like water? Not sure. Might not be the safest idea given my brain weirdness.

What do you love about your foster family? They totally get me and donât try to force lovey dovey stuff down my throat. They seem to genuinely love me though. And I feel safe. ?

What was your life like before being brought into Norcal Bully Breed Rescue? I was at a shelter and the staff there really liked me so they worked hard to get me into a rescue that took medical cases.

Dolce is looking for a permanent home. Would do best in a home with just \""her person\"" only.
Dolce is a hound / pit mix who was a FOAC dog adopted about 4 years ago.

Dolce is spayed / up to date on shots / microchipped. Best placement for her is into a home without other dogs, kids, or cats. Sheâs prefers to be with just her person. Has always been indoors and always had someone home 24.7.

She knows sit, stay, shake paws, leave it, lay down.
Barks if the doorbell rings or if someone knocks, won't 
attack. Simply prefers a quiet and mellow environment. Because she's quiet and mellow, just 
dislikes competing for attention.
If you would like to meet Dolce, call the FOAC Adoption Center 209 533-3622 10 - 2 Monday - Saturday
To adopt, fill out an online adoption form at FOAC.US completely and submit Adoption upon approval."

Hello everyone: this is Woody. He is a lab/pit mix. He is a little over a year old. He is neutered, He was rescued from a shelter after being found tied to a tree with a leg so damaged it had to be amputated and taken to a fabulous foster home. He does Incredible on 3 legs and can even go up and down stairs. All anyone says about this sweet boy is how much he likes to cuddle with you.  He is very precious and a very good dog. He does have separation anxiety though as do most shelter dogs. They have had a rough life and been left alone. The foster home he has been at now for a few months has 2 other dogs and they are all starting to fight.  So now it looks like Woody would do best at a home with no other dogs or cats. If anyone can help this sweet 
boy please call me

Snoopy is friendly with everyone he meets but will likely be a good watchdog as well. I KNOW that Snoopy will be great with young children; he met two kids (ages 8 & 10) and was literally melting in their arms. Snoopy is very affectionate and loves to snuggle right next to you in bed.

Snoopy gets along fine with other dogs, but he does have a prey drive and doesn't seem to know what a little dog is; therefore, I am seeking a home with no small dogs. (I'm confident that once he realized that little dogs are indeed dogs, he'd be fine with them.) Snoopy prefers to receive attention from humans much more so than from other dogs, so he'd be fine as an only dog.

I have not seen Snoopy around cats, but since he went after a Chihuahua mix, I can't consider a home with cats for him.

Snoopy is housetrained and never had an accident in the house he's in, but he does occasionally get his paws up on the counter if there is food present. He responds well to the \""sit\"" and \""lie down\"" commands, so apparently he's received some obedience training in his young life. 

Snoopy walks very well on leash and rides calmly in a vehicle. He apparently enjoys water, as he took to the pond at GSRSV's rescue ranch fairly quickly.

Snoopy gets his name from his long snout and the somewhat comical overbite in his muzzle. I'm not sure if his overbite originates from another canine breed (Collie?) but it does not affect his ability to eat normally. 

GSRSV rescued Snoopy from the Stanislaus County Shelter on 6-23-18. He had been at the shelter since May 12; I imagine that he was a staff favorite at the shelter. Nonetheless, his time had run out and he was going to be euthanized so GSRSV appealed for donations to board Snoopy until he could be transferred to a no-kill shelter out of state. Three women came forward with donations to cover his boarding expense. (Thank you Danielle Blount, Diana Cheung and Alicia Navarro!) When I discovered what a sweet dog Snoopy is, I searched for and was able to find a foster home for him so that he wouldn't have to go back to a shelter. 

Snoopy is located in Sacramento. His adoption fee is $210."

		Pacino is an almost 7 year old handsome sable-colored male, weighing 89 pounds.  He was originally a stray, so nothing is known of his original start in life.  Based on some of his behaviors, ie, teeth chattering when excited, he may have a touch of malinois in him for good measure. He has been in our rescue for 9 months and all of his fosters love him.

		He is housebroken, uses a dog door, and will go into a crate.  He gets along best with other female adult dogs, but can be a bit pushy for other male dogs.  He loves going on walks, but can pull hard if excited about something.  If given a good corrections, he settles back down.  He is also great in the car.  Pacino tries to push boundaries when it comes to some behaviors, ie,  counter surfing and sneaking on the couch when he thinks no one will notice.

		The foster family call him the Squirrel Hunter.  On patrol 24/7, there are no errant squirrels in the yard perimeter!! 

		In public, he is very especially affectionate and loves scratches and pets. Pacino is quick to offer his paw to new folks, so they can get to know him better.   When settled at home, Pacino does not easily accept strangers entering the home.  His intros are best done slowly with him on a leash or from watching in a crate to realize the newcomers are acceptable to the human pack.

		Pacino came to us with bacteria resistant ear infections.  He's had several treatments and been to a specialist.  Currently his ears are clear of infection, although regular ear washes are needed to keep them in check.  We are told he has no hearing from his right ear, but his left ear seems to compensate just fine.  

		This boy would do best in a home that enforces leadership to remind him who is in charge.  Regular exercise, car rides, plenty of affection and play time will make Pacino one happy boy.

		No small dogs, cats or small critters for this boy.

This dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.

For more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. 

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State.

Chuck is the most docile and sweetest dog ever, he wouldnt hurt a fly. He is very shy and rolls on his back when you try to pet him or pick him up. We believe he was abused and left outside to fend for himself with other dogs before he was rescued which is why he has âmistakesâ in the house âat timesâ, marks. 

He loves having access to the outside, and loves laying in the sun and also loves to cuddle in a warm blanket inside. 

He would thrive with someone who could give him the time, love and patience to break out of his shell.

 He LOVES other dogs and would do best with at least another one as it helps his confidence. He would do best with children old enough to know how to treat and handle a timid dog or a calm home.  Loud noises and yelling scares him.

He is a special boy.!!

Sox is a timid little guy. He was not treated very well before being dumped at a shelter. 

We believe he had never seen grass or been outside let alone on a leash. Sox has come a long way but still cowers when being pet and gets scared to be picked up although he is âveryâ sweet. 

He is more independent in his pack since he always gets pushed aside ... he often sits back letting the more confident dogs go ahead.

He would love his own lap. He loves to go on walks although used to be so scared of a leash. He trots and its the cutest thing. He gets along with other dogs and doesnt mind cats. He doesnt bark often but if a new face come over, doorbell rings, he gets scared by a new face, or other dogs start barking, he will join in and its quite a unique bark. We call it the rooster bark. 

Sox loves a warm bed and hates the rain so a potty pad would be ideal for him. 
Sox needs a calm home with patient and understanding people who will continue to work on his confidence.

She had been kicked so hard her femur head was damaged. The great folks at University of California Davis Veterinary School did surgery on her and repaired her leg. It has healed and she runs like the wind. If you didn't know she was injured, you'd never suspect it. 

Sydney was placed with a runner/hiker in our local area but came back to rescue about 6 months ago because her owner went to work with CalFire. She is a wild land firefighter and can be out for weeks or months at a time. She felt Syd needed a more stable living situation. She didn't want her to spend too much time kenneled while she was on a fire. 

Syd is great with dogs. She's good with people but can be a bit slow to adjust to new men. The guy who kicked her was tall. If you're tall, she'll come to you but she'll be wary at first. She'll bark in her crate at new people, but approaches immediately when she's out of it. We doubt this will go away. She's had some bad experiences but she wants to trust and love. Once she knows you, she'll happily climb right into your lap. 

Syd loves to go for rides and has great car manners. She'll hike or run in the forest or just hang with you while you watch TV. She's a buddy dog. She does well sleeping in a crate or on a pillow. She's reliable in the house and knows how to use a dog door. Syd loves toys. She's always carrying something around...toys, pine cones, sticks, etc. She's a toy dog. She's good with smaller or larger dogs, great on lead or off and ready for a new home. 

Syd is fostered in the Placerville area (near Sacramento). If you'd like more information, send an email to performanceresq@att.net."

Whatâs her name? Edith

How old is she? 11 years old

How much does she weigh? 18 pounds (should be 14 but TREATS)

What does she look like? Edith is blonde with short hair, a white muzzle and floppy ears. She is a glorious Puggle.

What does she like to eat? She eats Natural Balance Limited Ingredient High Protein Lamb kibble. She loves treats and is VERY food motivated but her foster mom is trying to help her lose weight.

Perfect Day? Waking up and eating breakfast. Going on walks and being outside. She would love to go for a morning walk and then come home and be lazy or cuddle with her foster family. She also loves, loves, loves car rides and will give you a guilt trip if you donât take her out often. Itâs a very effective guilt trip.

Favorite Toy? She is hilarious and very playful and loves soft stuffed toys. Sometimes she grabs them with her mouth and throws them up in the air. She also loves bully sticks!!!!

Tricks? No tricks for this old gal, just treats please!!!

Where does she sleep? At night she sleeps in her foster momâs room on her bed. She likes blankets and buries her head in them. She likes to be covered up so her foster mom tucks her in. During the day, she has a bed out in the living room. Sometimes her foster mom lifts her on the couch and she snoozes with her friend Tom the Chihuahua.

Walking on a leash? She loves walking on a leash. She drags her back legs a little but that doesnât slow her down.

What scares you? Nothingâ¦.but I do bark at fireworks.

Children? She absolutely loves children!!!!

Other Dogs? She loves other dogs! Verbally, sheâs a bit of a weirdo, loves to alert when she sees other dogs (typical beagle) but she has a TON of dog buddies and when properly introduced, is great around dogs.

Cats? She will chase cats if theyâre in the yard but in the house, she actually does really well with them. Sheâll try to say hi but if they hiss, sheâll respect the boundary.

Not so great habits? Itâs really unfair to call this a habit but Edith has a spinal cord injury. It is believed that she may have been hit by a car at some point in her life. As a result, she is 20% incontinent. What that means is that sometimes she canât quite make it out the door before she has to go potty. She also has accidents when she gets overly excited, (i.e., when her foster mom is putting on her leash to go out because walks are FUN).

Weâre working on feeding her early so she doesnât have accidents in her bed at night but her foster mom canât always get home from work early so sometimes it still happens.

She is very vocal when thereâs another dog in the house but when thereâs not, she is surprisingly quiet.

House trained? Edith is actually potty trained and makes every attempt to get to the door. Her success with having as few accidents as possible will depend on how easily she can get outside when she has to go (i.e., taking her down a flight of stairs is not ideal). The vet recommended that we express her bladder which has actually helped reduce accidents in the house quite a bit.

How is her health? Her health is great! Sheâs a little on the chubby side but we are working on that. Because of her spinal cord injury, she drags her back feet a little. Her back legs are stiff and donât bend very well so she needs to be lifted upstairs. Also, she sometimes cannot fully empty her bladder so her foster mom expresses it.

What does she love about her foster family? She is madly in love with her 8 year old foster sister and all of the friends that come over. Her foster mom lifts her on the couch every morning so she can snuggle with her foster sister before she gets ready for school. She loves car rides and walks.

Life before NorCal? We suspect Edith was loved very much. We have no idea how Edith ended up in the shelter but a dog with mild incontinence issues has almost no chance of being adopted out of a shelter so we had to save her.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Edith's adoption donation is $200 or waived for approved adopters 55 years of age or older.

Interested in meeting Edith or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

Cosmo has a small \""sister\"" dog who does not appreciate Cosmo's puppy play or great looks! ;) They have worked with a professional trainer, even though Cosmo is very submissive to the little girl dog (and most other dogs for that matter too), and Cosmo does great with her, but not the other way around! In addition, there was an incident with a visiting family member and Cosmo's food. 

Due to the incident with the food, we are looking for a new and forever family for Cosmo asap! His ideal home is one without any small or young children (because we can't risk them also tampering with his food). He loves to swim and gets along GREAT w/all other dogs he's met and if you fill out an application to potentially adopt Cosmo, and it looks like a good fit, we will have our professional dog trainer come to you and make the proper introductions there at your home, and also be \""on call\"" to assist you with fully acclimating and assimilating Cosmo into his new home, with all family members and your lifestyle! 

Cosmo is neutered, up to date on all vaccines, house and crate trained. First step in the process is to email us at shpssac@yahoo.com and request a Dog Adoption Application. PS The current owner had Cosmo DNA tested and it came back 90% German Shepherd/10% English Setter! PPS Be sure to check out the video of Cosmo playing in water and the last photo in the series especially, as that is Cosmo's \""Baby Picture\""! And here's a terrific video of Cos playing in the water:

Although she is approximately 10 years old, she is in good health, has lots of energy and appreciates a daily walk - a couple miles a day! She also loves lounging on her bed, enjoying the sun on the back patio or just hanging out with her people and resting. She also does well riding in a car.

She is friendly with children and adults but sometimes wary around other dogs.  Therefore, we feel Yoda is best suited in a home without other dogs.
Yoda is fully vaccinated (including the new flu vaccine), spayed, micro chipped and potty trained!  

She becomes anxious if left alone so a home where people are around most of the time would be ideal.  She is a jumper - as high as counter tops, furniture and gates. She doesnât bark much but will give a little growl when strangers come to the house but quickly warms up and then allows them to pet her!

Lucky Yoda has had some heartbreak in recent years and would love to find her forever home! She belonged to a family who lost their home in the recent California fires and unfortunately, they were unable to take her with them to their temporary accommodations.  Sadly, she was relinquished to the El Dorado County Animal Services. She was then quickly adopted by a gentleman but her happiness was short lived.  He broke his hip 2 weeks later and she was again returned to the El Dorado Shelter. Unfortunately, she did not do well in the shelter.  It was quite a scary place for her.  Thankfully, a loving foster home was located where her true gentle spirit has blossomed.  In that her health and confidence are now restored, she is ready to find a family to call her own!

I need to find a home with someone who is very patient and will give me a chance to get over all my fears in this scary world and develop my true personality. It's a terrible thing to lose everything I was familiar with and start over at my age. I'm sure I'll adjust, but it will take some time. 

What I do have going for me is I'm excellent with other dogs and I rarely bark, unlike many dachshunds who don't know when to keep quiet. I even finally sat on Mommy's lap, and it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. I am coming around, you see, but I still need someone with some patience. In return for your patience, you'll have a little girl who will love only you for the rest of her life.

		Suarez is a handsome 18 month old sable male. He came to us through a local shelter so little is known of his background. He originally tested as heart-worm positive but has successfully completed his treatment.
		
		While Suarez can be nervous in new environments and with new people, once he gets comfortable, this young boy is very affectionate and just wants to be with his humans. 

		Suarez is always excited to go out for walks and walks well on a leash. He knows some basic commands such as sit and has learned to sit and wait for his food or to come in from outside.  He appears housebroken and is OK in a crate.

		Suarez is an active boy with a lot of energy. He loves to run around and wrestle with the female Shepherd in his foster home. When excited, Suarez can be very mouthy and doesn't quite understand that playing with humans is different than playing with other dogs.  We recommend no children under the age of 12 for this boy. 
He loves car rides, but needs to trust the person loading and unloading him from the car or he can go into protection mode.  Suarez is neck and collar sensitive, will attempt to correct his human and will do his best to get his way. A quick firm correction lets him know who is in control and having him drag a leash until he learns this is inappropriate is also helpful. 

		This boy will do best with a strong handler who understands the need for constant, consistent leadership    and who will continue his training, exercise and socialization. He would also love another active large dog to play with and help teach him the ropes.

This dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.

For more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. 

We operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the 	Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State.

My name is Lola, aka LalalalaLola, Lolita Mamacita, Lowes, Lolo. (My humans love nicknames.) I answer to all of them, especially if there's food or a rubdown involved. My humans called me Lola because I am low to the ground. I think I'm just aerodynamic.

I came to my humans with four itty bitty puppies, which I cared for and played with, until they got their new homes. I am proud to say I raised beautiful, if rambunctious, pups! I think I'm only around 3 years old, so I was a really youthful mother.

My perfect day is: get up; stretch in my crate; eat breakfast; go outside and potty; sunbathe in the backyard (I know all the best places to go as the sun moves); hangout and watch TV with my humans for awhile (especially Animal Planet, I sleep if the news is on); hang out in my crate until the big guy gets home; go for a walk; eat dinner; go potty and watch some TV before bed.

I am learning good manners. I know sit, down, leave it and off. I obey about 80% of the time. I also know to wait for my food and to wait to be invited in the house or out the gate. I am a work in progress. With consistency I'm a fast learner and love to make my humans happy.

I love to fetch exactly 2.5 times, with great enthusiasm. My favorite toy is...I'm not sure. I eat them before I grow to like them. But a frozen cow bone section keeps me happy for months.

I love humans of all shapes and sizes. Cuddling is my favorite game. My humans say I can't hold my licker, but I think they secretly love it. It's really hard to keep all my love inside. I gotta let it fly!

Speaking of flying, I have been known to scale my six foot fence. My humans are working with me on staying inside the fence. I also prefer to be the only dog in the house. I really like watching them on TV, but don't see the need to share my home with them. With all this love, why would you want more than me?

I have a very waggy tail and a happy go lucky disposition. Give me a home and I'll give you all my love and my very best efforts to melt your heart!

Lola should be the only pet in the house. She prefers to be able to only have to share her love with her humans. ???

Here is Lolaâs original post from when she was still in the shelter. She was known then as Godiva.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). 

Lola's adoption donation is $200, but waived for the month of September!!

Interested in meeting Lola or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

It only takes him a day to feel comfortable with you.  He's a great dog, just very reserved and quiet.  BUT NO ONE WANTS HIM...which has probably been the story of his life.  His shyness for strangers stems from the abuse he suffered before coming here.  But here he can be animated and likes his walks with the various volunteers. He's an 8 yr old Great Pyrenees/Anatolian mixed breed with lots of love to give.  In his younger years, he was a loyal companion.  He overcame some horrendous conditions and once he gets to know you, he's a big goofy baby.  He's a big dog and is house trained and would be the perfect front porch dog.  He's housebroken and I'm sure he'd be happy to lay by the fireplace and protect the couch.  He'd be perfect in a quiet environment as the only dog although he does like other dogs. His heart is full of love and he'd like to give that to your family.


Note:  Great Pyrenees are considered a Giant Breed.  Average weight can be 100lbs. or more.  They bark, shed and have a wanderlust, so secure fences are a must-have.  They are NOT off-leash dogs and a Pyr off-leash is called a \""dis'a'Pyr\"".  Some Pyrs do well with other dogs and some don't because by the virtue of the breed traits they were bred to keep out intruders and can consider some dogs as intruders. While they make wonderful pets and family dogs, they aren't for everyone so be sure to understand and learn about the breed traits of this breed or any breed you might be considering."

Barney is pure love.  He adores people and he simply cannot get enough of them.  If you are seeking a true companion, Barney is your guy.  He will be by your side and be your best buddy for the rest of his life.  Heâs a shyer guy, so he does need to feel safe before he goes exploring but he just needs an understanding adopter who will go at his pace.  We donât believe Barneyâs previous life was very good because heâs fearful of new men when he meets them and when exploring a new area he will often low crawl and move very slowing, making to sure itâs safe.  Heâs also very sensitive to voice corrections.  Itâs likely Barneyâs previous caregivers were not very kind to him.  But Barney is now in foster care and getting all the love we can give him to make up for lost time.  Barneyâs heart is so big and despite whatever heâs been through, all he wants is someone to love.  Heâs a true bully through and through and a perfect example of what makes bullies such amazing dogs!  Barney is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, heart worm negative and house and crate trained.  

Child appropriate? Barney can be fearful of new things and experiences and he hasnât been around children to our knowledge so the best guess we can give is kids over 14 would be ok.  Heâs very sweet but he still mouths when excited and frequently paws at you for attention so we feel heâs best suited for kids he canât accidentally harm.

Other dog appropriate? Barney played with other dogs at the shelter, even a very exuberant female, and he did well.  He seems to enjoy the company of other dogs and plays nicely. We think heâd enjoy a calmer, medium energy dog of the same size as him.  

Cat appropriate? Barney appears to have a quite a prey drive toward the farm animals at his foster home so because of this we are thinking cats might not be an option for him.  Itâs not out of the question and he hasnât been formally cat tested so we are just guessing on this one.   

How is he with strangers? Barney is a little reserved with strangers, especially men.  He will spooky bark at new men but once heâs given some treats and allowed to approach the men without the men trying to pet him and get in his space, heâs completely fine.  Once heâs met the man and determined heâs ok, Barney is all love from there on out.  His fear is only upon the initial meeting.  He does fine meeting new women.  

What is his play style? When playing with other dogs Barney will engage in play and chase and will tolerate a dog being a little pushy but he seems to prefer to play a bit calmer.  When playing with people Barney can get overexcited and this causes him to mouth so keeping the energy lower key is best for him.  Heâd much rather sit and get pets and rubs vs. play anyway.

Does he like toys? Barney loves his toys!  He likes stuffies and rubber squeaker toys and he doesnât really destroy them.  He really likes any toy you can stuff with treats and peanut butter like Kongs and other food puzzles.  

Does he like water? Barney does not appear to like water. He has access to a pool but does not go in and does not show interest in the hose.

Does he like car rides? Barney rides well in the car and likes to look around.  He does prefer to climb his way to the front seat to sit next to his person, but thatâs because he loves people so much.  He will also lay down in the back seat and relax after a bit.  

Exercise level needed? Barney would do fine with daily walks and getting to run around the yard.  He does need to get some energy out, but heâs not going to need hours of exercise a day.  He loves to bird hunt so running around the yard looking for birds helps get energy out too and heâs very inquisitive.  He is not a dog you could take running with you but he could make a good hiking companion for someone.    

Behavior issues?  As mentioned previously, when excited Barney can mouth a bit and occasionally his kisses turn to teeth but he is continuing to receive training around this and needs to be reminded that itâs not ok.  He does get a bit squirmy when putting his harness on or when leashing so heâs working on that as well.  He just needs patience with this.  Barney does have some separation anxiety, which means when home, he must be kept crated in a heavy-duty crate because he does search endlessly to get out of wherever he is if left alone.  Barney can escape any outside kennel so he should not be left alone outside ever.  Having an adopter who works from home or where someone is home more often then not would help this issue.  

Medical issues? Barney tends to have running eyes but there doesnât appear to be anything wrong with his eyes.  A vet has checked him and itâs just something that he has.  It doesnât cause any issues, we just wipe away his eye boogers!

Skills? Barney knows âsitâ and heâs working very hard on âwaitâ before going in and out of doorways.     

Special/endearing things? Barney is SO soft that youâll want to spend hours just petting him and rubbing his squishy neck!  Itâs a good bonus that Barney loves being petted because the two go hand in hand!  He loves love and he loves being with his people and heâll make an amazing companion to someone who is truly looking for a companion.  Barney is sensitive and can be shy and this just makes him even sweeter.  He longs to be a part of someoneâs family and get to hang on the couch.  In his foster home he has is somewhat isolated due to the other foster dogs in the home, and Barney hates this because he just wants to be a part of the family, all the time.  Barney has the prettiest gold tinted hair and we joke that heâs gold plated!  He has so much love to give someone and heâs so happy each day to see people that we just know heâs going to make someone super happy some day.

Ideal home? Barneyâs ideal home would be one where someone is home often and where he wonât be left along for long periods of time.  Barney needs a home that is willing to invest in a heavy-duty crate to help Barney with his separation anxiety when they are gone.  The ideal home would be one that has a secure, 6 ft. solid wood fence in the back yard because Barney can climb chain link and heâs a master escape artist!  We havenât seen him climb a wood fence so we think that will do the trick.  Barney would love to be the star of the show and be the only pet in the family but he would likely be ok with another friendly, calm dog.  Barney needs a home who will be patient with him and allow him to be the house dog that he is as heâs not really the kind of dog who wants to go to public places.  Due to his wariness of the world, heâs just happier being home.

He was found as a stray so we donât have any history on him.  Heâs a sweet, older gent who is looking for a quiet home where he can enjoy his days soaking up the sun and enjoying a nice chew toy.  He enjoys the company of people and would make a nice companion for someone as he is low key and low maintenance and pretty easy to care for in the home.  Porkchop is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, heart worm negative and crate and house trained.  We want to give this guy a loving forever home where he can feel safe and comfortable and grow old.  Seeing dogs like Porkchop, who have had their ears chopped off and who appear to have not been given the best of lives, we want to make up for lost time and show him the good life.  Could you be the one to shower Porkchop with love and kindness?

Child appropriate? Porkchop would do fine with kids 12 and older. He likes kids just fine but because he's older, we don't want him in a house with a lot of small kids running around and causing too much activity and energy for him. He would prefer a home more on the mellow side. 

Other dog appropriate? Porkchop enjoys other dogs and would do best with another mellow dog who is not high energy. He'd enjoy a companion to wander around with and lounge in the grass next to.

Cat appropriate? Porkchop hasnât shown signs of prey drive towards cats when he sees them through gates or fences but because we think his eyesight may be a bit compromised, we arenât sure how much he can actually see them.  With slow and prop intros he could very well be cat appropriate.

How is he with strangers? Porkchop has met a few strangers inside and outside the home and been fine.  He seems happy to see people but is still a mellow dude.  

What is his play style? When playing with other dogs heâs pretty mellow and not too over the top so heâd be best with a dog of like energy.  When playing alone heâs pretty low key. He mostly likes to gnaw on his bones or chew toys. He does get a good case of the zoomies now and again :) 

Does he like toys? Yes! He loves strong toys he can chew on. He will destroy toys after a while so more durable ones seem to be best. He also likes to run around with a stuffy on occasion.

Does he like water? It is doubtful Porkchop is a water dog. He's too short and stout to swim and he shows no interest in the pool or hose.

Does he like car rides? He seems to enjoy car rides and jumps right into the car and settles in the back and just chills. Heâs an easy rider and probably enjoys being with his person more than anything else ? 

Exercise level needed? Porkchop is pretty low key so he doesnât need a lot of exercise.  Heâs a stout guy so he isnât going to run marathons!  Lying around the back yard in the sun or lounging on the couch is preferable.  He would do fine with a daily walk around the block. 

Behavior issues? At the shelter Porkchop failed the test for resource guarding his toys and high value treats such as bones and chewies; however, we have not seen this in his foster home. We DO NOT take toys, food or bones from dogs, as there is no reason to do this, so it's very easy to just leave him be. We can sit next to him when he's eating or chewing on a bone or toy and even pet him and he has no issue with this, therefore, we do not feel this is really an issue at all.  He can also be a little mouthy when playing and needs to be reminded that mouthing isnât acceptable.   

Medical issues? Porkchop has recurring issues with his ears and his eyes.  They get a bit oozy and crusty and need to be cleaned daily by wiping them.  He has responded well to over the counter Vetericyn  and Vetericyn Plus Antimicrobial Ophthalmic Gel.  Itâs inexpensive and has really helped keep those areas clean. His ear issue resulted from someone chopping off his ears too short and now his entire inner ear is exposed to the elements with no protection to irritants.

Skills? Porkchop knows the commands for âsitâ and âcrateâ and is house trained. 

Special/endearing things? While Porkchop was more reserved when he first went to foster, with time he started warming up and is becoming a professional snuggler!  Porkchop may never have lived in a home before and because he is more reserved he just needed time to adapt.  He is extremely loving and really prefers to be around people. He does not like to be alone and if you are in the room with him, he'll be next to you. He's extremely mellow and the easiest dog in the world to care for and sometimes you don't even know he's there! One of his favorite things is to have the outside of his ears rubbed and he will moan and groan in delight ? He also loves to get butt and belly scratches. He is a sun baby and will sunbathe for as long as he can!  His giant head is also quite endearing as sometimes weâre all amazed at how he stands up without tipping over, lol!  He has the cutest little compact body then there is this big olâ noggin attached to it and itâs just one of the many cute and silly things about this nugget! 

Ideal home? We feel Porkchop would do best in a home that is low key and quiet where he can spend his days lounging and relaxing.  He might be great for a single older person or couple or anyone who is not looking for an active dog but more of a companion to pass the time with and keep company.  Porkchop doesnât have desires to travel the world, heâs mostly content with a couch, a sunny back yard, chew toys and someone to give him rubs and scratches so finding a mellow home who can provide this would be awesome for him.  It would also be fabulous to find that special someone who doesnât mind a little (lots of) drool in his/her life!"
1658,41314383,CA2336,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/flower-41314383/ca/auburn/one-by-one-rescue-project-ca2336/?referrer_id=9825d0c8-29d4-4feb-9841-e9bfcd37fd1b,Dog,Boxer,Shar-Pei,TRUE,FALSE,Brindle,,,Adult,Female,Large,Short,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,FALSE,Flower,adoptable,2018-04-03T04:36:04+0000,Auburn,CA,95603,US,89423,9/20/2019,"Flower is a 5 year old mixed breed dog in need of a loving home.  She was surrendered to the shelter with her brother after her owner no longer wanted to provide adequate care.  She was very bonded to her brother and it was very sad when they were separated.  Flower was terrified and shut down at the shelter and it was very difficult for her there.  Once in a foster home, Flower began to blossom.  She started socializing with other dogs, opened up to her foster mom and is now a sweet and loving companion in the home.  She has enjoyed trips to the park to play ball, has even ventured to a pet store for an outing, and is enjoying life in a home.  Flower is a shy girl who needs a home where she can feel safe and being the opportunity to flourish.  She has so much love to give and sheâs a bit like super glue once she loves you, we simply canât wait for her to find the lucky family meant for her.  She is crate trained, house trained, UTD on vaccinations, heart worm negative, and microchipped.  

Child appropriate: Flower has not been around children while in foster care and we donât know about her time previous to the shelter.  She is a bit of a shy girl and children can be scary to shy dogs so weâd suggest children over the age of 12 just so they arenât overbearing.  

Other dog appropriate: Flower is dog friendly.  She lived in a home with many dogs and is used to being around them.  In her foster home she has two doggie friends, a male and a female and hangs out with both of them without incident although she does seem to prefer the male to the female a bit more. Sometimes if she gets too excited she is a bit pushy but will stop immediately when told to be polite.  We think Flower needs to be around at least one other dog friend her size because she really opens up around other dogs.  

Cat appropriate: We do not know how sheâd be with cats as she has not been around them.  

How is she with strangers: Flower can be shy with new people and takes time to open up but she has improved drastically during her time in foster care.  She prefers to greet people at her own pace vs having people invade her boundaries and start petting her head or grabbing her face, etcâ¦if given time, she warms up nicely and likes treats but she needs to be given space until she feels comfortable.  

What is her play style: Flowerâs play style is med to med high.  She does best playing at medium level and does well.  As mentioned previously, if she is overexcited, she gets a little pushy and has to be redirected.  This is easily accomplished with words and being shown direction.  Flower is very sensitive to correction so it doesnât take much to verbally get her to slow/calm down.  

Does she like toys: Flower really enjoys playing ball and that is her preferred toy of choice.  She enjoys some of her chew toys as well and really likes bully sticks and other things like stuffed Kongs.  

Does she like water:  We do not know at this time as she has not been around water.

Does she like car rides:  Flower rides well in a car without any issues.  

Behavior issues:  Flowerâs only issue is her shyness and the time it takes to warm up to new people.  She is just a less trusting dog and needs adopters who understand that and allow her the space she needs.  

Exercise level needed:  Flower would do well with a once or twice daily walk and some time playing ball in the back yard.  She is a medium energy dog so she doesnât need extensive physical activity but she is still young so moderate exercise would be nice for her.

Medical issues:  Flower came to us with some ear issues due to ongoing ear infections.  The shelter vet said that Flower simply has a condition where she is susceptible to ongoing ear infections that can easily be treated with antibiotics.  Keeping her ears clean will also help this issue.  So far while in foster care she hasnât had any ear issues but we monitor them daily.  

Skills:  Flower walks well on a leash and knows basic obedience commands such as sit and down.  She is very smart so will easily grasp additional commands if taught with positive reinforcement training.  

Special/endearing things:  Flower is 100% dedicated to her human and wants to please at all times.  She is a great snuggler and really loves sitting with her foster mom.  She is very sweet once she opens up and has a huge heart.  She is a quiet dog who rarely barks which is a nice trait.  She has overcome so much and itâs been wonderful watching her blossom in her foster home.  She is quite obedient and pretty easy to take to the park and other places.  She walks great on leash, which is a blessing any time that happens, lol!  Flower loves other dogs and her caregiver and these are great traits for someone looking for a dog friendly dog and one who also connects and bonds with their caregiver.  She simply wants to be where her caregiver is at all times, which is very appealing to those who love a doggie companion!  If given a chance, Flower is going to be an amazing family member to one lucky family!

Ideal family:  Flowerâs ideal family is one where there is at least one other dog.  Because she gains confidence through other dogs, itâs essential that she have a dog companion.  Shy dogs often do so well when allowed to have a dog companion.  Her ideal home would be one who understand a shy dog and accepts the shyness.  Too many people think a dog should have to endure being grabbed in the face, petted on the head, and forced into social situations when itâs completely unreasonable to expect this of the dog.  Shy dogs, just like shy people, just need time and space to feel comfortable and need to be allowed to go at their own pace.  As stated, Flower is a loving companion once she knows and trusts you.  Her ideal home would be one where there are no younger children and where she can get the time and attention she needs and deserves.

She is a mixed breed girl who comes in at a tiny 80 lbs, lol!  She's a big girl but she's full of love.  Starla was found as a stray so we do not have any history on her prior to coming to the shelter but she's spent time in her foster home and has proven to be a true lover.  She adores people and enjoys the company of other dogs.  Starla is crate and house trained, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, heart worm negative, spayed and healthy.  

Child appropriate? Starla would do fine with older children who can respect her boundaries and let her feel comfortable.  She's been around kids and done well and likes to give them kisses!

Other dog appropriate?  Starla is hot and cold.  She likes the dogs she lives with but she has not done well on recent dog meet ups.  We have learned that she needs time to warm up.  Once in the home, allowed to be crated near another dog, and develop a relationship, she is fine.  She just doesn't do well with immediate meet ups due to fear.  If someone is interested in fostering to adopt, that would be ideal as she warms up to other dogs in the home.  She would also do great as an only pet.

Cat appropriate?  Starla is pretty focused on cats so we don't think she'd do well in a home with cats.  She might chase them a lot which could stress them out.  

How is she with strangers? Starla can be shy upon first meeting new people so we always start with treats.  She seems extra shy with some men but warms up quickly once she finds out they are nice.  She may need slow intros or ones done with treats just to make her feel at ease but she' met many people and done really well.

What is her play style?  As mentioned, Starla is a big girl and she can get a little rambunctious when playing but she tires out quickly.  She loves to roll around and wrestle with her foster brothers but is gentle. She's isn't a super high energy girl and she tires out pretty easily.

Does she like toys?  Starla enjoys stuffies and will carry them around but she doesn't seem to play with them a lot.  She really likes her ball and loves to play fetch.  

Does she like water?  She will not go in a kiddie pool and doesn't seem excited by the hose so we'd have to say she's not a fan of water.

Does she like car rides?  Starla is a bit shy about getting into the car but once in she rides well.  We wouldn't say she loves car rides but she does ok when having to go for a ride.

Exercise level needed?  Starla would do fine with a daily walk around a mile or so and some time playing ball in the back yard.  She is a medium energy level dog and does not require extensive exercise to wear her out.  

Behavior issues?  Starla can be shy when meeting some new people.  When she's with someone she trusts she does well but if out of her element she can be shy.  When first at the shelter she was nervous around men but over time has overcome that and since being in foster care has met several men and lots of people and done great.  She just needs to be given some treats and spoken to kindly and she warms right up to you.

Medical issues?  None known.

Skills?  Starla knows sit and down and is working on returning her ball to you during fetch.  

Special/endearing things?  Starla is a very loving girl.  Even though she is almost 80 lbs, she will try and sit in your lap if she can get there.  She adores people and she's very gentle for a big girl.  She's a great combination of loving and snuggly and playful.  If you are looking for a true companion to adore you, this is your girl.  Watching Starla play with other dogs is extremely heartwarming too.  She seeks so much joy playing with her foster siblings and she's very trusting with them.  She is one of those dogs who just craves interaction and attention from everyone around her and exudes happiness.  She also loves to give kisses, did we mention that?  She is the make out queen!  She will come over and plant a big wet one on you and then leave a little slobber behind so you remember her :)  Many people are scared of big dogs like Starla but she will prove to you that big ol' bullies are kind and loving souls whose only danger is smothering you to death with kisses!
 
Ideal home:  Starla would do well in a medium energy home where she can be a part of the family.  Since she can be shy on occasion, a home that isn't super busy would likely be best.  She would do ok with kids as long as they are respectful and don't try and ride her like a horse or pull her ears etc...We think a home with another friendly dog would be great for her since she enjoys playing with her four legged companions so much.  We'd hate for her to be the only dog where she misses out on that playtime.  Starla is a lover so it's imperative that she go to a home who has the time to give her the attention she deserves and really care for her.  A home with large dog experience is a plus because it's very different having a 77 lb. dog than a 40 lb. one."

*All of our rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and microchipped*


Short-Stack has been with us for several months now. We haven't posted much about him because he came with many issues we needed to address one by one. First, he needed to feel better. He had disgusting blisters between his toes and all around his paw pads which made it excruciating for him to take a step, much less go for walks, tolerate being handled or work in his training. He also had two extremely bad ear infections, so much that the vet stated he couldn't hear anything due to the swelling and them being packed solid with crap?? So two very basic senses and abilities were EXCRUCIATING for this poor guy.... 
Next, he was emaciated and severely underweight. Which understandably lead to the discovery of his food aggression. Lord only knows when he was fed by his former owner. He was still intact so he marked EVERYTHING upon arrival. We were under the impression this boy was adoptable but once he arrived from the shelter, his issues came to a head. There was a big dispute about a civilian who went to adopt him with his young children the same day we pulled him and they accused us of basically conspiring to keep him from them. HAH! people can be so ignorant to the process. Well, knowing what we know now, Short-Stack would have absolutely mauled these kids if they were to hang all over him on the car ride home because he was in so much damn pain. Or he would have bitten someone when they reached to take his food which would have led to him being euthanized, or they would have thrown him away when he marked their entire house! So YOU'RE WELCOME we got there first, for everyone's sake. Especially Short-Stacks. The shelter had no clue he was in such debilitating pain so his reactions were understandable to us. He was also terrified, absolutely fearful of everyone. The worst sort of aggression is fear-based, especially when the source of fear is unknown. Fearful dogs are unpredictable. Short-Stack didn't trust anyone (after whatever he's been through) and he became very stiff and growled at anyone new. This was not good.
But with time and patience, he began to feel better and he began to trust his foster mom. This isn't the sort of dog that can be fostered by anyone. He required a very experienced foster who knew what to do and how to do it. 
Fast forward to today, Stacks is doing great! He loves the company of his foster siblings. He goes up to new people and asks for belly rubs now. He adores his foster mom and his playful side is absolutely adorable. Since he is only a foot tall lol he cracks us up when he rears up and waves his short little 2 inch arms all around??
Short-Stack has made HUGE progress and to the right person or family, he will make an excellent companion. He still doesn't want you near his food, especially other dogs, but he ALWAYS gives a warning, which we can absolutely appreciate. As much pain as his ears were in, he lets his foster mom tend to them but when he's had enough, he growls and yanked his head away. He lets us know when he is done and we listen. He doesn't want to hurt her, but he himself is in pain so he lets us know...we very much respect his thresholds and with continued training, desensitization, Stacks will have a happy ending with a family who loves and respects him.
Don't let his cute size fool you, he is very much a Rottweiler and has the same personality and protective qualities Rottweilers are known to possess. He definitely does not have to be the only dog in the house, but he will need an experienced handler who understands his body language and will protect him from anything the big, bad, terrible world and his previous life and owner has caused him to fear. 
We love this big goof and there is someone out there for everyone:) even our little, big boy. His head and body are normal dog Size, his legs are just 2 inches. Short-Stack is recommended for a home with no kids or teenagers with experience."

He weighs approximately 55 lbs. and is a medium sized dog.  Irish is a sweet boy.  He is well behaved and he's very experienced living in a home.  He enjoys the company of his foster caregiver and getting to sit on the couch and hang out but he also loves chilling by himself gnawing on a good bully stick or antler.  He enjoys playing with other dogs and he's one of those dogs who we consider low maintenance because he's an all around great boy!  He is neutered, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, house trained and crate trained and ready for adoption!

Child appropriate? Children 8 or older should be fine.  Irish needs some work on his jumping due to excitement and is a bit frightened by loud noises so we think he would do best in a home with older children.   

Other dog appropriate? Irish enjoys the company of other dogs but needs slow intros.  He lived in a home with a dog his size and a small dog and did well but he is shy at first and needs time to adjust to new companions.

Cat appropriate? No kitties for Irish. 

How is he with strangers? Irish greets strangers happily and seems fine with new people.  He can be more interested in his surroundings than people sometimes which isn't a bad thing!

What is his play style?  Irish is goofy and silly and loves running around with toys and romping with other dogs.  He does jump occasionally but does so in a playful, happy way and is quite gentle.  He will wrestle with another dog as long as he feels safe.

Does he like toys? Yes, he really loves his giant Nylabone toy and will chew on it for hours.  He seems to prefer things he can chew vs. stuffies but he won't turn a stuffy down!  His favorites are antlers, bully sticks, and hooves.

Does he like water? He doesn't go in a kiddie pool so it doesn't appear he's crazy about water but he's never been to a lake or pond so that might be different.  

Does he like car rides? He doesn't seem to love being in a car, he's a bit anxious, but overall he rides ok.

Exercise level needed? Irish would do well in a home where he can get daily walks around the neighborhood for a mile or so and has a yard to run around.  We would characterize him as medium energy.  He might enjoy being a jogging partner too!

Behavior issues? Irish needs slow intros to new dogs and he can sometimes be reactive on leash.  Once he develops a relationship with his caregiver and feels safe, he does much better.

Medical issues? None known.

Skills? Irish knows how to \""sit\"" can \""shake\"" knows \""down\"" and can catch food in the air.  

Special/endearing things? Irish is goofy and sweet and loving.  Once he warms up to you he loves cuddles and makes a great couch buddy.  He is content to play with his toys as well.  Irish is very, very smart and learns very quickly.  He is still very active and playful, very puppy-like despite being 6 years old.  You get the best of both world's with Irish-puppy fun without the puppy behavior!  He is fabulous in a home, very well mannered and which makes him a near perfect companion!

Ideal home: Irish's ideal home would be with a family who is medium activity and enjoys spending time with Irish.  He would prefer a quieter home where there isn't a ton of stimulation.  Children would be ok as long as they are a bit older and have learned dog manners.  He is very, very sweet and wants to please his people and love on them.  He is a family dog and is used to being part of a family so he would need to be treated as a family member in his new home.  He enjoys the company of other dogs once he gets to know them so having another doggie playmate could be nice for him.  He would not do well in a home with cats as he does try and get to the cats in his foster home.  If you have been a looking for a truly sweet boy who is smart and loving and a little goofball, come meet Irish and you're shopping will be done!"

Ginger (AKA: Gigi Bee, Gingy)

How old are you? 
3-4 years old

How much do you weigh? 
A perfect 50 lbs!

What do you look like? 
Super cute with a sweet face. I am fawn colored with white on my chest, paws and a little on my nose.

What do you like to eat? 
I LOVE to eat. My foster mom prefers beef or lamb food from Costco, but I will eat just about anything. I am very food motivated.

What kind of personality do you have? 
I am a sweet girl who loves to play, but I also love my naps. I am still a bit shy and timid around new things & people, but give me a chance and you will see what a love I really am.

Describe your perfect day: 
Going for my morning walk or playing fetch (I have been doing very well at dropping the ball at foster momâs feet), playing with my foster brother, then sleeping on the couch with my foster mom. I also love playing with human foster brother. He feeds me treats when mom isnât looking!

What is your favorite toy? 
Bones, balls and anything that squeaks. I am very good at playing by myself. I also love sticks.

Do you know any tricks? 
I can sit (hand and voice command), wait, place and I know âoff.â My foster mom is working on getting me to lie down, but I am not too fond of that.

What scares you? 
I do not like loud noises and sometimes new people worry me a bit. But, my foster parents take me on new adventures and help me get used to new things.

Have you been around children? Do you like them? 
I LOVE children. My foster parents have 6 grandchildren between 1-10. I am gentle, patient, and let them give me hugs and kisses. They know they arenât supposed to touch me when I have food or a chew toy, but I never mind when they do.

Do you like cats? 
Whatâs that?

How do you feel about other dogs? 
I love other dogs. My foster brother LOVES to play. My favorite is being chased and then jumping in my pool!

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? 
With my forever family. Walking, playing, swimming, napping.

How is your health? 
Great as far as I know. I donât have to take any medicine.

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? 
I live with my foster mom, dad, human and canine brothers. I love my foster mom the most, but my foster dad is great too!

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? I'm comfortable with hanging out in my crate.

Where do you sleep? I happily sleep in my crate.

Do you like walking on a leash? 
Yes, but I do best when I have on my training collar.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? Sometimes, I bark at strangers and things I havenât seen before and I get excited if I see other dogs on walks. But, my foster parents always tell me what a good girl I am.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) 
Yes. And I will let you know if I need to go out!

Do you like playing in water? 
I love being in the water. I love to swim in the creek and fetch sticks. I have a small pool that I love to sit in or wrestle my foster brother in.

What do you love about your foster family? 
They show me love, consistency and keep me safe. They are teaching me how to be a real dog!

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? I was found as a stray. My foster parents think I was caged, bred and abused. They are teaching me that not everyone will hurt me and that not everything is scary.

**NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We usually require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home.

This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We are, however, willing to adopt out of our area, including the Bay Area, Tahoe, and even further. We've even adopted out of state on very special occasions.

We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog.

Our adoption fees are based on the dog and range from $200-$350. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary).

The adoption donation for Ginger has been covered by a generous donor!

Interested in meeting Ginger or any of our available pooches?  Complete and submit our adoption application on our website norcalbullybreedrescue.com and we will respond to you within 24 to 48 hours."

www.gofundme.com/teddyandcoco
These sweet souls had a terrible start to life. Coco is Teddy's mom and they were both surrendered to the shelter by their \""owner\"" for barking too much in the backyard. They were outside dogs and never stepped foot in a home or had a family to love them the way they deserve to be loved. Coco Teddy were in the WORST condition. They both had 3rd degree skin infections all over their little hairless, bleeding and puss-filled bodies. We could just vomit from the stench of them! Coco had a tumor the size of an apple hanging off her from leg. HOW could someone let their dogs get to such a horrible state? Well when all you do is breed them and sell their puppies, then you don't have much room for anything else. It appears that Coco was a breeding female and Teddy was her son that the family decided to keep from perhaps her last litter or maybe he wasn't good enough to sell. Well we say he is too good. Coco is about 4 and Teddy is around 2 years young we think. Teddy's skin was so bad, we couldn't even pet him when he first arrived. He was oozing from every little wrinkle and fold on his tiny little stalky legs :( At first, we thought they HAD to have demodectic mange. But after two skin scrapings, they came up negative. So you mean to tell us that these two got to THIS condition from just mere neglect?? SHAME ON YOU! We cannot imagine how they even survived this long.... Both dogs had the worst ear infections we have ever seen OR smelled. 
The moment these two arrived to us, we opened the car door to the transporter and they both greeted us with full body wags and slobbery kisses.... It simply broke our hearts into a million pieces. Even in this condition they still love humans, even though our kind did this to them... they hold no grudges and still offer their entire hearts to us. We love them already and we won't let another soul hurt them like this again.

Coco is doing much better! Her fur has grown in, her staph infection is gone and she is feeling like a million bucks! Both Coco and her son Teddy will need to remain on allergy medication for the rest of their lives. These two are worth every penny we have spent on them, which totals close to 7k to date. We continue to ask for donations for their care, as their medication costs about $200 a month each. Our hope is that we find them loving homes that can afford to continue their medication. Looking forward it may cost between $60- $200 a month depending on which route the owner decides to take. There are variations of treatment such as weekly allergy shots, different prescriptions, etc. Teddy and Coco are squatty, loving dogs who absolutely adore humans despite the torture, abuse and neglect our kind has inflicted on them until now.


Coco loves the car and would be a great little dog to take everywhere with you! Have lots of love to give? Coco is your gal!

1671,34841494,CA2336,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/snoopy-34841494/ca/auburn/one-by-one-rescue-project-ca2336/?referrer_id=9825d0c8-29d4-4feb-9841-e9bfcd37fd1b,Dog,Staffordshire Bull Terrier,Mixed Breed,TRUE,FALSE,Gray / Blue / Silver,White / Cream,,Young,Male,Medium,Short,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Snoopy,adoptable,2016-04-06T23:58:19+0000,Auburn,CA,95603,US,89423,9/20/2019,"Snoopy is a 60 lb., 3 year old mixed breed pup who came to us from Yolo County Animal Services after being surrendered by his owner.  He was only a year old and had experienced a lot in his short life and shelter life was no better.  Snoopy was stressed in his kennel and let staff know that he needed to get out of the clink. Once out of the shelter and into his foster home, he changed drastically.  He is a happy, fun and silly young boy and he's got a ton of energy!  He adores people and wants more than anything to be a lap dog and is the most lovable boy around.  He is crate trained, house trained, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped and neutered.  

Child appropriate? When growing up Snoopy lived with a 7 yo child but since then he hasn't been around children.  We feel he would do best in a home with children 8 or older because he is very rambunctious and could knock over younger children.  He has no aggression issues at all but he is a little brick house :)

Other dog appropriate? Snoopy likes other dogs but he's a rough player so he needs a doggie friend who can tolerate his play style and exuberance.  A dog that is tolerant would be a good match.  He has played with dogs in his foster home and has no issues.  

Cat appropriate? No kitties for Snoopy.  

How is he with strangers? Snoopy loves everyone he meets and has met many strangers at adoption events and just tries to climb into their laps.  He is wonderful with everyone he meets inside or outside the home.

What is his play style? When playing with other dogs he can be very pushing and rough because he's very excited, but after the initial meet up he calms down and goes off chasing birds or hunting in the bushes, his true passions.  He doesn't do well if corrected by another dog because he doesn't understand the correction well and he can respond by snarking back which can lead to a scuffle if the other dog won't back down.  While he loves people, if alone with a person he will choose to run around the yard and explore vs. hang out with his person. 

Does he like toys? Yes, Snoopy enjoys toys but eats them up pretty fast.  He loves collecting all his toys in one area and he can be a bit of a guarder with his things.  He likes tug toys and stuffies, tennis ball, food puzzles, pretty much anything.

Does he like water? He has not been around large bodies of water since being with us and does not go into the kiddie pool but he does love splashing through puddles! 

Does he like car rides? Snoopy gets car sick so he does not enjoy riding in cars.  Trips to the vet he can handle but needs to be crated because he will throw up.  He would not be a good match for people wanting to take their dog traveling.

Exercise level needed? He will need daily exercise to help get his energy out and make him a happy dog and you a happy pet parent. Snoopy is young and very active and he loves to explore.  Giving him an outlet for his energy helps him remember his manners and helps him be a better dog.  Daily walks or hikes or short jogs would be great as well as playing around in the back yard.  He loves to hunt for things so hiding his toys in the back yard is a fun way to make his brain work.  

Behavior issues?  Snoopy's only behavior issues is he still gets excited and jumps up to greet people.  He loves people and it's hard for him to contain his excitement.  He has improved in this area a lot.  He also has a tendency to pull while on leash and he must be on a Freedom Harness to help control him as he will pull like crazy if on a regular leash to collar.  We do not use prong collars or other forms of painful control but Snoopy doesn't need that anyway as he does well with his harness.  He can sometimes be reactive to other dogs while on leash out walking.  He tends to have some protective qualities and feels the need to protect his people so he needs a leader who can make him feel confident that protection is not needed.  Snoopy needs to know he is safe with his person than he does great.   

Medical issues? None known.
?
Skills? Snoopy knows how to sit and do a \""watch me\"" and he's learning more tricks every day!  A lot of Snoopy's training has focused on impulse control, as he can be very stubborn about what he wants and forgets his manners, so we are continuing to work with him on trading his toys, learning \""drop\"" and \""place\"" and waiting before going in and out of doors.

Special/endearing things? Snoopy is such a love.  He is so happy all the time.  He embraces life like no other.  Despite having a rough start to life than being placed in the shelter and several foster homes, he is still so happy.  He is probably the happiest dog we've ever had in the rescue.  He is sweet and loving and will do anything to sit with you on the couch.  He wants to please all the time and so he'll do anything to make you happy.  He is spirited and will put a smile on anyone's face.  We want so much for this boy to find the love he deserves and will give him as much love as he gives out!

Ideal home? Snoopy would do best in a home with an active pet parent.  He is still young and therefore has lots of energy but with proper exercise he turns into a couch companion. Snoopy could benefit from a home that is interested in training him either with agility or something active.  He is very smart and keeping his brain busy helps him do better all around.  He adores people so a home where someone is home more often than not would be good for him.  He is a wonderful little companion and he longs to be near people so we really feel he will blossom in a home where he gets lots of love and attention and is a true part of the family.  A home that appreciates a happy, energetic boy is desired because he would not do well in a laid back home where he gets very little activity or attention."
1672,34531382,CA2336,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/wendell-34531382/ca/auburn/one-by-one-rescue-project-ca2336/?referrer_id=9825d0c8-29d4-4feb-9841-e9bfcd37fd1b,Dog,American Staffordshire Terrier,,TRUE,FALSE,Yellow / Tan / Blond / Fawn,,,Young,Male,Large,Short,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Wendell,adoptable,2016-02-23T21:30:50+0000,Auburn,CA,95603,US,89423,9/20/2019,"Wendell is a big, lovable, snuggly 4 year old male American Staffordshire Terrier mix who is just about the sweetest guy around!  He adores people and will let just about anyone give him a belly rub!  He has been to numerous adoption events and he blows everyone away by being the most well behaved dog at the event.  After settling in, he just lies down and relaxes. He greets people nicely when they come to say hi and craves attention and love. He really needs a home with a big back yard and the space to be the little rhino that he is.  Wendell is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, heart worm negative and house and crate trained.  

Child appropriate? Wendell would do best in a home with kids over the age of 10.  Heâs just a big boy and needs to be around people he canât accidentally injure when heâs playing.

Other dog appropriate? Wendell enjoys the company of other dogs and would enjoy a playmate who likes to play somewhat rough but is easy going enough to tolerate an energetic young man!  Wendell prefers larger dogs near his size and would not be suitable with a small dog.  

Cat appropriate? Wendell has not been directly cat tested but did not show a high degree of interest in the cats in his foster home.   

How is he with strangers? As mentioned, he has attended many adoption events and does great meeting strangers.  Heâs a pretty happy boy and is happy to see anyone who will give him attention.

What is his play style? When playing with other dogs Wendell is rough and tumble and really prefers to wrestle with other dogs.  We liken it to a couple lions on the range!  Wendell sometimes doesnât take cues from other dogs and can continue to push them to play which can be annoying to the other dog which is why he would do best with a dog who likes to play but can tolerate his sometimes difficulty with saying no.  When playing with people Wendell will match the energy so if the person gets really hectic, that can lead Wendell to jump and get a little rough so itâs best if people keep their energy to a minimum when playing.

Does he like toys? Wendell loves stuffies and will immediately destroy them with great joy but isn't that what stuffies are made for?!  He enjoys most toys and will chew on bones and bully sticks too.

Does he like water? Wendell enjoys water from the hose but we arenât sure about bodies of water.  

Does he like car rides? Wendell rides well in the car and doesnât seem to have any issues with it.  

Exercise level needed? Wendell needs daily exercise of a nice long walk in the neighborhood or even a short jog to tire his mind and body.  He isnât a marathon runner or anything but he does need activity to get his energy out.  He is not a dog park kind of dog, due to his lack of picking up on other dogs cues, so that wouldnât be a good option for him.  His adoptive family needs to dedicate time to giving Wendell mental stimulation through food puzzles and physical stimulation through exercise.  

Behavior issues? Wendell can be jumpy and sometimes mouthy or start humping when overexcited.  This is exacerbated because heâs bigger and that can hurt smaller people.  He isnât aggressive at all, itâs just excitability, but none the less, it can scare some people.  It only happens when heâs been overstimulated.  

Medical issues? Wendell does have some allergies that appear to be seasonal so he will need allergy treatment during those seasons when they flare up.

Skills? Wendell know âsitâ and âdownâ and âcrateâ and could benefit from continued training.  He is very food motivated so that helps with training and it would be great to for someone to work on his impulse control through teaching him âwaitâ at various distances.   

Special/endearing things? Wendell is a super sweet boy and has so much love to give. Wendell loves to cuddle and loves being on the couch with his people.  He is a very loyal companion and once he loves you, he loves you hard. He's easy going and really not a lot of work at all. Wendell craves human attention and really wants a family to call his own. He is a versatile dog who can go almost anywhere with you and people tell us all the time how handsome he is. He's a goofball trapped in the body of a supermodel and that's a great combo!

Ideal home? Wendell needs a dog savvy home because while he has come a long way in his training, he still needs guidance from his person to help him calm down when he gets excited.  He is very smart and he wants to please so someone who can continue his training with lots of love and praise will be the right family for him. Wendell needs a home with children over 10 and no small pets.  He will need a home dedicated to giving him exercise each day via nice long walks and even playing with him in the yard.  He is a bigger dog so he does tire out but he needs the activity to also tire out his mind."

We know, we know, we say that about a lot of dogs, but once Lou Lou loves you, he loves you hard and loves you for life! He is so crazy happy to make new friends!  He is a young boy at just around 3 1/2 years old and he weighs around 70 lbs.  Lou Lou is one of those dogs who is going to need to meet just the right person with a huge heart who is willing to give him what he needs to have a happy life.  We know someone is out there and we are willing to wait until we find him/her.  Lou is a very special soul whose heart may be too fragile for this scary world but if you gain his trust, he'll be the best friend you will ever, ever have.  He is crate trained, house trained, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, and neutered. ?

Child appropriate?  Lou Lou would do best in a home without children.  He is a very shy and sensitive boy and just does better with adults.

Other dog appropriate? Yes!!  Lou loves other dogs and loves playing.  He plays a bit rough and tumble but if another dog is ok with that, he will be great.  He really shines when he's around other dogs.  He has several foster siblings who he plays with and he's done really well with all of them.  He's only been around one small dog, a 7 lb. chiweenie puppy, but he did very well with so it appears he likes both big and small dogs.  We think other dogs give him confidence which is something he needs.

Cat appropriate? No kitties for Lou.

How is he with strangers?  Lou Lou needs very slow, structured intros to new people.  This is his special need.  He is shy and insecure and because of this, his hair will go up and he may spooky bark.  Through training and time in foster care, we have learned it is best for him to meet strangers by going on a short walk and having the stranger toss treats to him.  After about 10 minutes, he's great, but he needs to know he's safe at first.  Seriously though, once he's over his initial fear, he will remember you and love you from that day forward.  

What is his play style? He loves to run around and do zoomies.  He can be a bit rough at times and needs to be reminded not to jump or snatch toys from you.  He respects verbal corrections to calm down when given.  He is fun to play with though and will mind his manners when reminded to do so!
 
Does he like toys? He enjoys playing with stuffy toys and balls but he prefers people to toys.

Does he like water? He has not been around large bodies of water but does take a dip in the kiddie pool occasionally.

Does he like car rides? He rides fine in a car but is very vigilant of life around him.

Exercise level needed?  Lou Lou needs medium exercise.  He needs a place to run around and do zoomies and get energy out but if he has another doggie companion, that helps too.  Without another dog, he would need to be walked daily or played with in the back yard.  

Behavior issues? Lou Lou came to us in need of intensive training for barrier aggression and fear of strangers.  He attended an 8 week board and train program where he learned manners and learned to trust new people.  He overcame his barrier aggression but will still need to be managed in this area.  Barriers can be crates, fences, cars, anything he is confined behind or within.  He has done awesome with this since leaving training but it's always something that will need to be managed by his adopter.  His fear of strangers has improved drastically; however, when meeting new people for the first time he still struggles with them just approaching him.  We have found that if he is walked on leash near the new person for just 10 minutes or so, while the occasional treat is tossed his way, he warms up and is fine with the new person.  We all have quirks and this is just one of Lou Lou's.  Once he knows you he loves you with all his heart and is wonderful, he is just nervous at first.

Medical issues?  No known medical issues

Skills?  Lou knows sit, shake, touch, down, off, wait and come.  

Special/endearing about Lou Lou? Lou Lou is so incredibly loving and sweet.  He adores people and wants nothing more than to snuggle up on the couch, give kisses, and be as close as possible.  He is so trusting once he gets to know you and he has the biggest heart.  Lou Lou doesn't 100% trust the world, and who can blame him, his time at the shelter was not a happy one and his life before that was worse.  He has come so far and would be the most wonderful family member to an adult home if someone would give him the chance.  His behaviors are very easy to manage and it's worth it to get such a fun and loving dog.

Ideal home? A home with only adults is preferable and one where there are not a lot of child visitors.  Lou Lou is not comfortable around children as they frighten him.  He would do best in a home that is low key and doesn't have a ton of visitors and activity.  He is a dog who prefers to be home and is not the kind of dog one can take to public places.  He just doesn't feel safe out there.  A home where he has a nice big yard to run around and a family who understands just how special he is.  No kitties but another dog would be perfect for him as he gains confidence with dogs and really enjoys playing with them!"

Kylie, Kylie Monkey

How old are you? Between 5-6 years old. But age is only a number!

How much do you weigh? Well... I'm not sure how much I weigh, but I was a little chunky monkey, so foster Mama put me on a diet. I'm lookin good now!  Best guess is about 50lbs.

What do you look like? I have a beautiful white coat over spots that are on my skin. I have soft, uncropped ears and a sweet face.

What do you like to eat? My foster Mom likes to mix it up a bit, so I don't get bored, being careful not to create tummy upset either. Currently, she's got me on Nature's Domain Salmon and Sweet Potato in the morning and Grandma Lucy's freeze dried food in the evening.

What kind of personality do you have? I'm a total tomboy and definitely NOT afraid to get dirty! I'm a rough and tumble kind of girl who enjoys playing with my foster sister, swimming and rolling in the dirt. I also enjoy sunbathing, but since I'm so fair, sunburn is a concern!  My exercise needs are medium - I like a walk or a short flirt pole session, then I'm ready to relax for the evening, chilling out cuddling while watching tv.

Describe your perfect day: Hanging out with my family doing whatever and playing with my canine sister.

What is your favorite toy? I love the Kong Wubba that my Auntie Susan brought me and I like to chew on Nylabones.  I also enjoy playing with the flirt pole and catching my frisbee!

Do you know any tricks? I do! My foster Papa recently taught me to shake - with either paw! I also know the basic obedience commands sit, down, and stay.  My newest trick is rollover!  I also like to catch a frisbee!

What scares you? Not much. I'm a pretty confident girl. Tho I don't much care for the landscaper and his loud tools.

Have you been around children? Do you like them? I have not spent much time around children and because I can forget my manners and jump up when I'm excited, older, dog savvy kids would be the best match for me.

Do you like cats? I'd rather live in a home without them.

How do you feel about other dogs? I can be selective about my canine friends and do best with more submissive dogs my size and/or larger, and slow and proper introductions are a must. In my foster home, I hang out and play with my foster sister.

If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? Anywhere my family is - that's when I'm happiest!

How is your health? I'm in great health. Healthy teeth, shiny coat and getting trim too!

Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? I live with my foster Mom and Dad and foster canine brothers and sisters. My closest companion is one of the other foster dogs who live here with me. Her name is Tessa and we do everything together. She's my best friend.

Where do you hang out when you are home alone? In my crate. I'm fully crate trained and see it as my little safe place. But honestly if I was adopted and left home alone, I'd just sleep on the couch and not chew on stuff. I'm pretty good like that.

Where do you sleep? On the living room couch with my canine foster sister, Tessa. Sometimes, foster Mom and Dad let me and Tessa sleep in bed with them - it's a super treat!

Do you like walking on a leash? Yes! I enjoy going for walks and am pretty good on leash, but get excited when I see other dogs. I will sit politely for treats and give my handler my attention when they pass.

Do you have any \""not-so-great\"" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard? I don't typically bark, but if there is a snarky dog on the other side of the fence, I will run along the fence. I'm not sure if I'd dig if left alone in the yard, as my foster folks let me stay indoors when they aren't home.

Are you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) I am completely housetrained!

Do you like playing in water? I LOVE water! My foster Mom and Dad bought us dogs a kiddie wading pool and I really enjoy splashing around it! They also take us to the lake from time to time and I love swimming in the water!

What do you love about your foster family? My foster Mom and Dad have been very patient and kind with me. They have helped me learn how to be a good canine citizen by taking me to LOTS of training classes. They go camping a lot and they almost always take us dogs along too! We even went all the way to Utah for four trips in the RV!

What was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? 
I don't remember a whole lot about my life before my rescue. I found myself at the shelter after being picked up in a rice field by the ACO. Not too long after passing my behavior eval and going on the adoption floor, I began to show signs of kennel stress and began displaying bad behavior brought on by that stress. Shelter management decided that I needed to find a safe place to go if I was to leave the shelter alive. The volunteers at the shelter were very nice to me and took me for walks every day to help me handle my stress. Some nice volunteers worked hard to find a safe place for me and I've been in my foster home ever since.

NorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread all throughout the Sacramento area. We require our adopters to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of us, depending on the dog, and depending on the home. This is because we need to do a yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. We try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. Adoptions are not done on a \""first come, first serve\"" basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog.

Kylie's adoption donation has been sponsored by a generous donor.

*All of our rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and microchipped prior to their adoption.*  

Brooklyn is an adult with the temperament of a puppy! She is simply stunning and has a goofy personality. Brooklyn came to us from the Bay Area where her time was running out in the shelter due to space. Unfortunately there is no such thing as a no-kill shelter. All shelters have to euthanize for space as well as test dogs for their adoptability. Many of the temperament testing is extremely stringent and perfectly good animals fail due to the stress they are under or the environment they are in. Brooklyn was saved just in time! She is just GORGEOUS and truly one-of-a-kind. If it's attention you want, just take this girly for a walk around the block :)  Everyone comments on her unique colors and look. Brooklyn was a bit excited when she first arrived but she has settled in quite nicely. She wants to play with all the dogs around her and has shown no signs of dislike for anyone or anything. In fact, she would play constantly if you would allow her too, ha! But on the other hand, she has shown her foster momma that she is good for cuddling too!!  She would love nothing more than to play by day and snuggle by night. She could defiantly benefit from an experienced owner to continue working on her manners as well as handle her strength and her energy. Don't let her small size fool you, she is a tank of brute strength! She is learning to walk gently on her leash and most of the time she just wants to play with it, haha!  Brooklyn is fully crate trained, will walk in on command and lay down. She will not make a peep and waits patiently to be let out. Brooklyn also knows âdownâand \""shake\""; She is super well socialized and would do great in any environment although her playful antics and curious nature can certainly annoy some other dogs. She is a staff favorite at the Vet's office too!! If you think Brooklyn will be a good fit for your family visit us at pitcrew.org and fill out an application form, we look forward to hearing from you :)

Astro is very sweet and loving. He's a quiet guy who loves to have a fluffy bed (he's likes his naps!) and treasures his toys. He can live with older kids just fine! They just have to be of an age to understand that his toys are SACRED, and don't grab them without asking or offering to play with him! High energy when playing, relaxed when not. Great on leash!

Astro can live with any submissive female. Probably not great to pair him with alpha males.

I stopped the car. Beneath the ears were two wide frightened little eyes. When I got out of the car, 4 little feet went into action and the eyes and ears disappeared into a woodsy area. I came back and set a humane trap. The next morning a frightened little puppy looked up at me with those two little eyes, wider than ever, within the confines of the trap, shivering like a leaf.  Men living in a nearby house informed me that this poor little pup had been living in the field off the scraps they'd fed her for a month. As young and tiny as she was back then, I considered it a miracle that she survived that long in the cold late winter weather. 
Once she was with me, her rehab into the world of humans had begun. For days she'd shake in fear anytime anyone came near, so I took things slowly. Within a couple of week the little orphan's fear was beginning to melt away as she slowly began to trust a human, perhaps for the first time ever.

She is so gentle with her little paws when she plays. She is teething so teething toys are helpful. She likes to go on walks and dart thru the grass running and jumping. She loves to cuddle and sleep in the bed. She is also kennel trained with the play pen area with potty pads. She makes cute funny sounds when she does not want to be put down from your arms. She has been living with a 14 year old male shih tzu during her foster care. She got along with him however she would do better with a dog that likes to run and play.

She is approximately 8 years of age, has more than likely lived on the streets for ALL her life being bred, litter after litter. She is what the vet and rescue community refer to as a âthrow away mamaâ as horrible as that sounds. Being used only to breed puppies and nothing more. 

DejaVu was found on the streets of Stockton, in the middle of busy traffic, dodging cars while barely able to walk. Fully covered in road rash and blood, no one stopped to help her. Until, her now foster mama spotted her, stopped traffic, picked her up and rushed her to the nearest emergency vet to be treated. 

She is now ready for adoption and looking for her FURever home. When you look into her eyes, you can definitely see how appreciative and happy she is to have a stable place to sleep, eat and play. She does AMAZING with kids, people, dogs of all sizes and ages. She is the epitome of  a âLOVEBUGâ. She does love to cuddle and sleep a lot. She loves short distance walks and will plot down when sheâs tired. 

Deja will do best in a quite home, where someone will be with her and not leave her alone. She does a bit of separation anxiety tendencies and as long as she smells or sees you, she will just sleep. 

We canât imagine the type of life sheâs had, but we know it was a horrible one. Now we promised her to keep her safe and never left feeling unloved. 

If interested in meeting or adopting Deja, please contact her foster mama.

I think I would be a great addition to any family! Since I am a senior guy, one of the perks about me is I know what I like which is people and getting attention from them and although I do not like to spend time with other male dogs I do enjoy the company of social female dogs. I can provide all the love and attention you are looking for and if you have a social female dog let's meet and see if she approves of me, I know you will."

Dan. Ozzy made us realize how unique and special he is, always showing everyone his unconditional love. Despite his disability he helped many of our fosters who were hurt and traumatized to recover, always showing his support and love. His magic personality makes every single person and animal fall in love with him to the point that you never want to leave his side. Once you touch his silky soft cashmere fur, you will always want to have that feeling every time you are near him. He reminds us of Falcor from movie Never Ending Story. Ozzy is a goofy little boy with sunshine in his eyes and a funny little bear walk, because he uses his front legs most of the time. He deserves a special family who will love him as his own child. We believe he can change someone else's life bringing lots of joy and happiness. We think Ozzy will fit into a low/moderate activity lifestyle, being around family members sometime during the day to keep him company, so he is not alone all the time and has a healthy amount of interaction.

Not excessively active inside, in the car, or shopping, and will enjoy a good pace on a walk or jog.-Moira We walked by a daycare and she smelled the grass and stayed calm. She saw a cat on my patio and when she tried to get close to it the cat ran off. We saw two other dogs on our walks and Kiella wanted to approach them and tuged on her leash. She was very calm but excited with other dogs. She enjoyed being around kids and let them pet her while she lied down. Her house training level was good and she had no accidents in the house.-Shonquinta She mostly ignored dogs but at Burgers and Brews she was very friendly to every dog that passed by. We were outside all day and Kiella would sometimes pull on her leash and stopped often to smells things. Kiella was quiet, chill, very strong, and likes being petted.

He is very smart and eager to please. He is potty, kennel and house trained and is very quick understanding your house rules and restrictions, and is very obedient. Randy loves small plush toys and balls that he likes to hold between his paws like a teddy bear. He adores children and has been gentle and loving around his foster mom's 9 year old. Randy is very tender and devoted. He will follow you around the house and lay by your feet when you work, cook or eat. When you lay down to rest or read, he'll cuddle next to your couch and in hopes of some belly rubs. Randy was gentle with backyard chickens living with him. He was very good walking with other dogs on the leash, but is missing appropriate dog to dog play manners, therefore we recommend him as a single dog, or will require an appropriate slow dog to dog introductions that will be necessary for another resident dog. Randy is very friendly to new people he meets on his walks, or when you have friends visiting, but will bark at a stranger trying to enter your yard uninvited. He is very calm and low energy at home, and didn't chew on anything, but he has relentless energy on walks and runs. He is making good progress on proper leash walking, and is a great running and hiking buddy.

Cash really enjoyed his treats. He didn't react to any kids he saw. When he saw another dog, he would start to pull towards them but didn't bark or growl. He did not seem reactive around any people or dogs. He does pull on leash, and loves to run. He is very affectionate and loves to be petted.-Joseph Cash ate plenty of treats and took them gently. He was excited to meet his resident dog and wasn't aggressive, he just was excited to sniff her. He is friendly to all people he meets. Cash doesn't get too tired, even on a long walk. He walks well on leash and enjoys his outdoor time. He can be a heavy breather, but he doesn't make much other noise. He is friendly and excited to be around you, and enjoys playing and going on walks. Cash loves to give kisses and will lick the back of your ears when you drive-Matt If you are interested in participating in our Doggie Day Out Program, please visit our website at cityofsacramento.org/Community-Development/Animal-Care/DoggieDayOut for more details."

I would enjoy walks on the beach but I've never been. I like lounging on my days off. I currently dont work, but if being in a house full of other dogs than I'm a nanny. I have 3 big dog foster siblings that I like to sometimes play with. They are respectful of not jumping on me cause I was in a bad accident, I'm healed mostly but I'm no gymnastic marathon running athlete. I'm more of a lay in my bed Netflix and chill type of girl. I'm also currently in my foster home with a cat I dont bother with and two small birds that are weirdos but I mind my own business. I'm also learning simple commands like when my foster mom and dad say \""come....come here...come pookie...come\ I then walk inside the house or wherever they try to herd me. Yup that's it about me, so if I sound like your kind of girl then shoot my peeps a DM. 

PS other dogs and small kids have to be respectful of my body, super loud noises scare me, and people yelling that scares me too.\""

When she does get affectionate she likes to climb on you. She shows potential to be a low maintence family pet but would greatly benefit from further training. We recommend a dog to dog prior to adoption due to her pushy introductions. We also highly suggest taking it slow when meeting her for the first time as she can be shy with strangers.

She jumped into the car ad put her feet on the console to see where they were going. They walked to a quiet residential area-Kristi Some kids under five passed by and Dottie was interested. Dottie was very curious about other big dogs and had friendly interactions with them. She was very friendly with other people and sat with a wagging tail as they pet her. She is a very quiet dog. Dottie is very curious about the world and enjoys being pet. She also loves to people watch. Dottie did well sitting on a restaurant patio. She did get very excited when food was delivered and gave adorable puppy eyes, once she realized she wasn't getting any people food she layed down and waited patiently.-Carol She is very quiet. Dottie is a friendly, active explorer. She wanted to say hello to everyone and loved all the pets and attention. She wasn't into treats.

He was badly matted when he came in. The staff clipped out his mats to make him more comfortable; but he really could use a grooming to get him back to being as handsome as possible. Mario currently weighs 41 pounds so he is considered to be a medium sized adult dog. This is a very nice dog who would be great in a home with children and other dogs. Mario is well behaved and calm so he could fit in just about anywhere. If you are looking for a wonderful family dog--come meet Mario!Dogs may be adopted for $120. Cat adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative."

He will be in the 40 lb range when fully grown. Who can resist those ears!
Before you just go gaga over his undeniable cuteness, please go do a bit of research on the temperaments, good & bad points of both Schnauzers and Heelers (Australian Cattle Dogs). Many a Heeler has been turned in to a Shelter for just being a Heeler, meaning they were nipping at the children's heels when playing which is simply what Heelers were bred to do, although to Cattle. But without livestock to 'heel' they will then find the next best thing which can be you, your children, your cats, your other dogs, etc. Schnauzers are wonderfully active, intelligent and funny dogs that were bred to be vermin killers so have to be careful around any kind of pocket pet (hamster, guinea pigs, birds, etc) or even potentially kittens. They can be talkative so something to think about if you are in an apartment or a quiet neighborhood. And they need good exercise of both their body and brain to keep them happy and well adjusted. What traits of each breed will Stitch have - hard to say but any potential adopter should pay more heed to their thoughts on both of these breeds over just how cute and photogenic Stitch is - that way he will be in a loving home for the entire of his life.

She will be in the 40 lb range when fully grown. Who can resist that face!
Before you just go gaga over her undeniable cuteness, please go do a bit of research on the temperaments, good & bad points of both Schnauzers and Heelers (Australian Cattle Dogs). Many a Heeler has been turned in to a Shelter for just being a Heeler, meaning they were nipping at the children's heels when playing which is simply what Heelers were bred to do, although to Cattle. But without livestock to 'heel' they will then find the next best thing which can be you, your children, your cats, your other dogs, etc. Schnauzers are wonderfully active, intelligent and funny dogs that were bred to be vermin killers so have to be careful around any kind of pocket pet (hamster, guinea pigs, birds, etc) or even potentially kittens. They can be talkative so something to think about if you are in an apartment or a quiet neighborhood. And they need good exercise of both their body and brain to keep them happy and well adjusted. What traits of each breed will Stitch have - hard to say but any potential adopter should pay more heed to their thoughts on both of these breeds over just how cute and photogenic Lilo is - that way she will be in a loving home for the entire of her life.

Weimaraner (or similar) breed ownership experience is required due to their traumatic background and lack of socialization. 

These 5 precious pups are about six months old. There are two boys (the grays) and three girls (the blues). They have all gained substantial amounts of weight since receiving proper care and we are addressing all their medical needs as quickly as we can. 

While we are accepting applications for their adoption, we do not know exactly when they will be ready for their forever homes. They need to be spayed and neutered, which will be done as soon as they are healthy enough. Priority will be given to previous WRS adopters and we will only place them in homes with at least one other dog; they cannot be only dogs. Weimaraner (or similar) breed ownership experience is required; due to their traumatic background and lack of socialization, these puppies are not suitable for inexperienced owners.

If interested in adopting one of these puppies when they are ready, please submit an application at www.weimrescue.com.

J is for joy, that you always bring.\""  My name is LJ and it's my 'ambition' to get a new home and it will be my 'joy' to find somebody to love who will love me back.  I'm a senior boy, age 11, who has lost his home because my former owner lost their home.  I'm kind of bewildered because I've been living with my owner since I was a puppy.  I'm not eating a lot right now.  I weigh 64 pounds.  I'm house trained, I've just received all my vaccinations and I'm neutered.   As you can see, I don't look like I'm 11; I have that puppy face and I like to dance around when I'm getting attention.  I was raised with cats and I'm okay with other dogs but don't like it if they jump on me.  I prefer a calmer companion.  I love to ride in the car and I always call \""shotgun\""!  I currently have an ear infection and that's probably why I'm a little head shy because it hurts.  You also have to be cagey with me and outsmart me to take pills because I'd rather not take them, thank you very much.  I'm available for the senior to senior program.  I'm really hoping that my handsome self will find a new home right away because it's scary and lonely to be homeless.  Goldens like me do so much better with people.  Please don't let me be lonesome for long.  Thank you."

My name is Cher because of my beautiful hair. It is so black that it is almost blue! My foster-mama calls me Lightfoot frequently because my feet barely make a sound as they touch the ground.
I am a survivor of being a teen mom, but I don't really know how old I am because those early days are a blur. A girl as pretty as me should not have had to live that life. I am petite, weighing about 50 pounds, but I'm working on adding a few more with all this good food and treat
s!

I think I can be dog, cat, and kid friendly if I have a strong leader. I don't know how to make friends yet, but I am trying. Cats are soooo exciting! They smell so good! I want to ... no, I'd better not. I'm very sweet to my people.
My favorite thing in the whole world is treats. Treats are even better than a bowl full of kibble! I will do anything, a-n-y-thing, for a treat. I have learned Potty, Sit, Down, Kennel, and NO! I'm doing great with all those, but especially NO. It's so hard not to find the cat and get to know it better, but I am learning! I saw a chipmunk this week and enjoyed chasing it through the yard. WHERE did it go?
I like to get my leash on to go outside, there is so much to sniff! I don't have good leash manners yet (I pull), but I am learning! I like my crate, my safe space, because when my foster-mama says \""Kennel,\"" she delivers the treats! I'm not really house-trained, but I haven't had any accidents in the house, either. All of these rules are new to me! I'm smart and a fast learner, especially when there are treats involved.
If I had a human job, it would be Safety Patrol. I'm always alert, checking on every little disturbance in The Force. No movement, no sound, no scent goes unnoticed. I am also VERY good at binge-watching Netflix. My adoption fee is $250. I'm spayed, up to date on shots, microchipped, heartworm negative, and current on heartworm and flea prevention.

BIO:  
Cricket came from Western Kentucky when his owners surrendered him to the local shelter.  Cricket:
â¢	Has a sweet, friendly personality.
â¢	Loves to curl up on an available lap.
â¢	Is very active and curious but also enjoys napping next to his person.
â¢	Sleeps all night in in his crate (with just a bit of initial fussing).
â¢	Gets along well with other dogs and cats.
â¢	Is working on sitting and waiting when its treat time.
â¢	Is potty trained.  He hasnât had any accidents.  Cricket loves the doggie door and goes pretty regularly with the word âpottyâ.  Of course, he runs right over for his treat after.     
â¢	Loves being outside exploring but checks in frequently using the doggie door.  A large fenced yard would be preferable.

Cricket is adorable and has the sweetest personality!  If you want a constant companion, he is your boy. Complete an application because this little cutie won't be with us long.

============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============

If you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. 

We welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. 

We will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.

To understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.

If you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.

Please don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \""new friend\"" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast."

He is an active and talkative boy who is good with other dogs. He does NOT do crating and gets frantic to get out. Hilton would a well-fenced yard and room to romp. Not a good candidate for an apartment since he can be so talkative.
This precious dog is one of over 60 we took in from a single voluntary surrender situation. These dogs have lived their lives outside in large pens so are NOT housetrained, not crate-trained, not leash trained. Many are super friendly, and we think will be fine with children but to our knowledge they have never been around children. It will be best for any children to meet them at our Shelter to make sure. Some of these dogs are shyer and may be more suited to adult only homes.
These dogs were all fed well enough but were covered with fleas & lived on dirt, so many do have hair loss as a result. A few have some Demodectic Mange which is NOT a contagious condition; we expect those with Demodex to clear up quickly now that they are spayed and neutered, fully vaccinated, flea free and clean. Going to a home full of love will also help immensely as they leave the stress behind of their previous living conditions and also the Shelter.
All those up for adoption have tested negative for heartworms but it is absolutely vital they be kept on monthly heartworm prevention from your Veterinarian to ensure they stay negative. If you are not familiar with heartworm prevention, please first talk to your Veterinarian so you are aware of the cost (minor considering that it saves lives) and are ready to ensure prevention throughout their lifetime. If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.
We look forward to all of these dogs being adopted into loving and responsible homes where they will get lots of attention, love and care, and never again have to be miserable from fleas and all of the inclement weather they have endured living outside.
Our adoption fees are $100 for dogs. This adoption fee completely covers the mandatory spay or neuter, basic immunizations, de-worming, microchip, heartworm check, rabies vaccination if old enough, free health exam with your participating veterinarian.
To meet all the great pets at our shelter come to 255 Central Plank Road, Wetumpka, AL, 36092, go to our website at www.elmorehumane.org for more information, email us at hselco@bellsouth.net for an Adoption Application or give us a call at 334-567-3377.

She loves to go on walks and get belly rubs. Freckles is a little chunk of housetrained and leashtrained love. She likes her crate and sleeps in it voluntarily most nights. She is independent, does not need a large yard, and is usually quiet but does do the beagle howl on occasion. She is a couch potato and needs someone who can exercise her regularly. Freckles is not a big snuggler and she does not usually jump up on people, but she can be very affectionate and cover you with slobbery kisses when excited. Freckles is located in Montgomery, AL.

She was at a high kill shelter in Alabama. Our foster family went to the shelter to pick up two puppies for our organization. But the 11 year old son of the foster family felt so moved while at the shelter when he walked by Lolaâs kennel...he cried and cried with feelings of empathy and sadness. Lola sitting in the back of her kennel with her head hung low. Hope was no longer something she had. She had given up on everything. She was afraid and very depressed...loneliness was the new norm for her. She came to realize that no one was ever coming for her and that she knew she was going to die in that shelter any day now. The 11 yo foster boy could feel all of Lolaâs emotions in the few minutes of seeing her. He noticed the dogs in the nearby kennels were all jumping at the gate and barking loudly. But not Lola...she didnât make a sound, didnât move a muscle. He told his mom âMom, we canât leave this dog here. She will die in here. No one else is going to save her. Sheâs crying mom.â His mom said yes to fostering her too! We agreed to take her into our adoption program and find her a forever home. 

We met Lola that afternoon. What a gem she is!! She is most kind hearted soul. She oozes gratefulness with every look and movement. She is calm, and she is soothing to your own soul. Something about her draws you to her. She loves children and is like a grandma to them...she lays next to them and just âchecking on them.â She has also taken on to mother the two puppies we rescued. She acts like they are her puppies. She licks them and loves them. 
We gave her a bath...she just stood there in complete contentment while the cold water hose was quickly rinsing her and we lathered her up. She is so trusting of humans. Itâs beautiful. Sheâs a beauty on the INSIDE and OUT!

She is like a butterfly in a dog body.  

Fancy LOVES everyone she meets and all dogs. Her foster home has dogs who can be dog selective but they all accept and get along with Miss Fancy. 

The perfect home for Fancy would be one where someone is home most of the time as she can get anxious when she is alone. She has some separation anxiety and does best when she knows someone is close by. She also needs another dog to hang with, one her size (41 lbs) or larger...she loves playing and running and needs a playmate.  Not only is Fancy a free spirit but she has the typical Husky trait of escaping. A privacy fence would be important, regular fences would be like not having one at all with this girl. She will NOT do well as an apartment dog or a situation where she would be crated most of the day. She needs human and canine interaction. Fancy is incredibly smart and gets bored easily which can lead to her getting into mischief. She would love to have older children to play with or to be able to go to work with her person. She might just be a great candidate for fly ball or agility.

His short coat is brown with pretty markings. You will notice that Romeo has a 'cherry eye'. A 'cherry eye' doesn't cause him any pain but if you adopt him your vet can advise you on it. Romeo weighs 14 pounds and we believe he will be a medium size adult dog (weighing between 30-60 pounds). He is a bit nervous when you first meet him. Romeo warms up quickly to a little cuddling and kind words. Like any young dog he is active and playful. We know he would appreciate a fenced yard where he could safely play. Romeo is not well leash trained so a little patience will be needed to have him walking on a leash like a pro. True to his name Romeo is very affectionate and sweet. He is going to make a great little family dog who will be good with other dogs and children ****Please note that when introducing a new dog into a home with children and other pets adult supervision is strongly recommended until the new dog settles in with the family.****Dogs may be adopted for $120. Cat adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative."

She is very sweet, loves attention and is VERY HIGH energy! She came to us originally with NO hair at all so her coat has recovered wonderfully. Paulie, like her sister Patty, is a very high energy dog and will need lots of room to run and exercise. See below for how we got Paulie:

This precious dog is one of 74 we took in from a single voluntary surrender situation. These dogs have lived their lives outside in large pens so are NOT housetrained, not crate-trained, not leash trained. Many are super friendly, and we think will be fine with children but to our knowledge they have never been around children. It will be best for any children to meet them at our Shelter to make sure. Some of these dogs are shyer and may be more suited to adult only homes.
These dogs were all fed well enough but were covered with fleas & lived on dirt, so many do have hair loss as a result. A few have some Demodectic Mange which is NOT a contagious condition; we expect those with Demodex to clear up quickly now that they are spayed and neutered, fully vaccinated, flea free and clean. Going to a home full of love will also help immensely as they leave the stress behind of their previous living conditions and also the Shelter.
All those up for adoption have tested negative for heartworms but it is absolutely vital they be kept on monthly heartworm prevention from your Veterinarian to ensure they stay negative. If you are not familiar with heartworm prevention, please first talk to your Veterinarian so you are aware of the cost (minor considering that it saves lives) and are ready to ensure prevention throughout their lifetime. If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.
We look forward to all of these dogs being adopted into loving and responsible homes where they will get lots of attention, love and care, and never again have to be miserable from fleas and all of the inclement weather they have endured living outside.
Our adoption fees are $100 for dogs. This adoption fee completely covers the mandatory spay or neuter, basic immunizations, de-worming, microchip, heartworm check, rabies vaccination if old enough, free health exam with your participating veterinarian.
To meet all the great pets at our shelter come to 255 Central Plank Road, Wetumpka, AL, 36092, go to our website at www.elmorehumane.org for more information, email us at hselco@bellsouth.net for an Adoption Application or give us a call at 334-567-3377.

Personality
I love to run and play especially with other dogs!  I love to catch people's attention by hopping up and down in place and wagging my long tail!  I LOVE attention! I am active but once I am brought back inside I will relax and watch what's going on around me. Nothing makes me more excited than my toy dinosaur and a little bit of canned food.  I will do anything for those! I have pretty good manners. I don't jump on people. I just jump and down in place when I am excited like a bucking bronco. Then when I get to run I leap through the air like a deer. I am young and very, very smart and willing to learn new things for snacks and new toys especially if it means we are going for a good run or to play with other dogs if I am good.

What we know about Garth:
*housebroken
*blind and hard of hearing
*loves to cuddle
*good with cats

What Garth's foster mom has to say about Garth:
Garth is a sweet little man who doesnât hesitate to let you know when he wants attention, is hungry or needs to go out! He will bark to let you know he wants something. Garth sometimes sleeps through the night, but not always. If he needs to go out he will sit up and move around to let you know. Garth prefers to sleep with you at night instead of in his dog bed. He loves to hang out with you when youâre home.

Garth likes to walk, which is good because he needs to lose another pound. He was a chunky monkey when he came into rescue. Garth would do best as a single dog, but he and my cat sleep next to each other every night.

Garth is also mostly deaf, but not completely. 
Blind Dog Rescue alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately."

Buster is a lot of dog in a smaller package. He is quite active and playful and very assertive with other dogs. He will be best with a larger dog he cannot bully. Just a lot of Terrier attitude but loves people!
This precious dog is one of 74 we took in from a single voluntary surrender situation. These dogs have lived their lives outside in large pens so are NOT housetrained, not crate-trained, not leash trained. Many are super friendly, and we think will be fine with children but to our knowledge they have never been around children. It will be best for any children to meet them at our Shelter to make sure. Some of these dogs are shyer and may be more suited to adult only homes.
These dogs were all fed well enough but were covered with fleas & lived on dirt, so many do have hair loss as a result. A few have some Demodectic Mange which is NOT a contagious condition; we expect those with Demodex to clear up quickly now that they are spayed and neutered, fully vaccinated, flea free and clean. Going to a home full of love will also help immensely as they leave the stress behind of their previous living conditions and also the Shelter.
All those up for adoption have tested negative for heartworms but it is absolutely vital they be kept on monthly heartworm prevention from your Veterinarian to ensure they stay negative. If you are not familiar with heartworm prevention, please first talk to your Veterinarian so you are aware of the cost (minor considering that it saves lives) and are ready to ensure prevention throughout their lifetime. If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.
We look forward to all of these dogs being adopted into loving and responsible homes where they will get lots of attention, love and care, and never again have to be miserable from fleas and all of the inclement weather they have endured living outside.
Our adoption fees are $100 for dogs. This adoption fee completely covers the mandatory spay or neuter, basic immunizations, de-worming, microchip, heartworm check, rabies vaccination if old enough, free health exam with your participating veterinarian.
To meet all the great pets at our shelter come to 255 Central Plank Road, Wetumpka, AL, 36092, go to our website at www.elmorehumane.org for more information, email us at hselco@bellsouth.net for an Adoption Application or give us a call at 334-567-3377.

My name is Ghost. I'm about 5 years old (old enough to know better, but still very youthful and playful). I weigh about 65 pounds.

I'm a beautiful white German shepherd dog. I play well with others. I'm gentle with small dogs, even annoying puppies. I like big dogs too. I'm a lover, not a fighter. I also have a cat friend.

I'm a really great dog. Some of the things you need to know about me: I'm crate trained, house trained, easy on the leash, and well behaved in public. I
get a little nervous and I'm busy but I settle down and can relax in a short time.
The only trick I know is sit. My foster mom makes me sit before she gives me my bowl of food (she's a meanie).
My favorite thing in the whole world is food. I like toys too, but food is the best!
I'm a little nervous on car rides and going to the vet. I whine in the car, but I don't growl or bite.
If I had a human job it would probably be activities director at a resort. When a new dog comes into rescue I will teach them about all the fun stuff in the yard: kiddie pool, where the toys are, and how to hide in the privet bushes.
I'm in perfect health except for EPI. I don't consider this a problem because its under control with a food additive. EPI stands for Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency. EPI is a condition where my pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to digest food. I could starve to death if it wasn't for a food additive. I do just fine with two tablets added to my meal (porcine pancreas tablets). I must have this additive for the rest of my life. It only costs $35 per month. I'm worth it.
I will be your best friend."

She is beyond sweet and loving and sadly also has heartworms. She started her 30-day treatment on 21 August so she will be ready to go to a new home late September.
Please also read below how we got Tula:

This precious dog is one of 74 we took in from a single voluntary surrender situation. Tula is one of the sweetest and happiest dogs. She loves life and smiles all day long. Tula loves to give kisses and doesn't meet a stranger. She is crate trained and loves to go outside and play. Tula finishes her Heartworm Treatment on September 18 and will be available for adoption after that.

All those up for adoption have tested negative for heartworms but it is absolutely vital they be kept on monthly heartworm prevention from your Veterinarian to ensure they stay negative. If you are not familiar with heartworm prevention, please first talk to your Veterinarian so you are aware of the cost (minor considering that it saves lives) and are ready to ensure prevention throughout their lifetime. If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.

We look forward to all of these dogs being adopted into loving and responsible homes where they will get lots of attention, love and care, and never again have to be miserable from fleas and all of the inclement weather they have endured living outside.

Our adoption fees are $100 for dogs. This adoption fee completely covers the mandatory spay or neuter, basic immunizations, de-worming, microchip, heartworm check, rabies vaccination if old enough, free health exam with your participating veterinarian.

To meet all the great pets at our shelter come to 255 Central Plank Road, Wetumpka, AL, 36092, go to our website at www.elmorehumane.org for more information, email us at hselco@bellsouth.net for an Adoption Application or give us a call at 334-567-3377.

He is mostly black and has gorgeous white markings. Steve currently weighs 32 pounds and we believe he will be a medium sized adult dog (30-60 pounds). He came to PAHS as a stray and his owner never came looking for him. Since he is a Border Collie mix he is active and playful; so we know he would appreciate a nice fenced yard where he could safely play. Steve is good with other dogs and would be just fine in a home with children. Please come out and meet Steve--he is just a great all around dog! ****Please note that when introducing a new dog into a home with children and other pets adult supervision is strongly recommended until the new dog settles in with the family.****Dogs may be adopted for $120. Cat adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative."

ADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.

Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.orgThe staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description.This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.

All pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.

He had a lot of hair loss when he came to us but is recovering well. These photos are mid-recovery.

This precious dog is one of 74 we took in from a single voluntary surrender situation. These dogs have lived their lives outside in large pens so are NOT housetrained, not crate-trained, not leash trained. Many are super friendly, and we think will be fine with children but to our knowledge they have never been around children. It will be best for any children to meet them at our Shelter to make sure. Some of these dogs are shyer and may be more suited to adult only homes.
These dogs were all fed well enough but were covered with fleas & lived on dirt, so many do have hair loss as a result. A few have some Demodectic Mange which is NOT a contagious condition; we expect those with Demodex to clear up quickly now that they are spayed and neutered, fully vaccinated, flea free and clean. Going to a home full of love will also help immensely as they leave the stress behind of their previous living conditions and also the Shelter.
All those up for adoption have tested negative for heartworms but it is absolutely vital they be kept on monthly heartworm prevention from your Veterinarian to ensure they stay negative. If you are not familiar with heartworm prevention, please first talk to your Veterinarian so you are aware of the cost (minor considering that it saves lives) and are ready to ensure prevention throughout their lifetime. If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.
We look forward to all of these dogs being adopted into loving and responsible homes where they will get lots of attention, love and care, and never again have to be miserable from fleas and all of the inclement weather they have endured living outside.
Our adoption fees are $100 for dogs. This adoption fee completely covers the mandatory spay or neuter, basic immunizations, de-worming, microchip, heartworm check, rabies vaccination if old enough, free health exam with your participating veterinarian.
To meet all the great pets at our shelter come to 255 Central Plank Road, Wetumpka, AL, 36092, go to our website at www.elmorehumane.org for more information, email us at hselco@bellsouth.net for an Adoption Application or give us a call at 334-567-3377.

Some of these dogs are shyer and may be more suited to adult only homes.
These dogs were all fed well enough but were covered with fleas & lived on dirt, so many do have hair loss as a result. A few have some Demodectic Mange which is NOT a contagious condition; we expect those with Demodex to clear up quickly now that they are spayed and neutered, fully vaccinated, flea free and clean. Going to a home full of love will also help immensely as they leave the stress behind of their previous living conditions and also the Shelter.
All those up for adoption have tested negative for heartworms but it is absolutely vital they be kept on monthly heartworm prevention from your Veterinarian to ensure they stay negative. If you are not familiar with heartworm prevention, please first talk to your Veterinarian so you are aware of the cost (minor considering that it saves lives) and are ready to ensure prevention throughout their lifetime. If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.
We look forward to all of these dogs being adopted into loving and responsible homes where they will get lots of attention, love and care, and never again have to be miserable from fleas and all of the inclement weather they have endured living outside.
Our adoption fees are $100 for dogs. This adoption fee completely covers the mandatory spay or neuter, basic immunizations, de-worming, microchip, heartworm check, rabies vaccination if old enough, free health exam with your participating veterinarian.

We don't believe Storm had much positive human interaction before being brought to into rescue and a Foster Home. Since being in Foster he has shown he'd love to be someones best Buddy. He is a little shy when you meet him, but warms up quickly and  loves attention and pets.  He stays inside the house at night and has never had an accident inside. Because he was without positive  human interaction until recently, He will need someone to be patient with him to build his self confidence and he will bloom into an exceptional companion for the right person or family.

He came to PAHS as an owner turn in because his owners could no longer take care of him. Diesel is mostly white but has quite a bit of black markings. He also has some brown markings on his head and face. Diesel is a good looking guy who has enormous and comical ears. Those ears have many different looks and they are most entertaining as you watch them! Diesel also appears to have a big goofy grin most of the time. He currently weighs 38 pounds so he is considered as a medium sized dog. Diesel is a very good natured dog who enjoys any attention you give him. He is leash trained but could work on his manners while on a leash. Diesel is a high energy fellow who would loved to have a nice fenced yard where he could safely play. Due to his extreme playfulness we believe he would do best in a family without small children under the age of six. Diesel would never intentionally hurt a child but in his exuberance for life he might knock a child down. He is good with other dogs. Diesel is such a great dog! With a patient owner who is willing to spend time with him Diesel's has great potential to be a wonderful new family member for some lucky adopter. ****Please note that when introducing a new dog into a home with children and other pets adult supervision is strongly recommended until the new dog settles in with the family.****Dogs may be adopted for $120. Cat adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices.

He loves to sun bathe and hang out with other doggie friends. He is dog and cat friendly. He would do best in a home with NO small kids. He can be a bit to nippy around little kids. He can handle older kids. He is a little reserved at first, but once he gets used to you, he will become your buddy. He loves to be picked up and held like a baby on his back. He would do better in a home with other dogs. He enjoys playing and having a snuggle buddy. He just wants his own human to love him like he deserves.

Pala loves playing with other pups and is curious about cats but not mean to them. She's working on her leash manners & basic obedience but will need someone patient to keep working with her. She's crate trained and almost completely house trained. 

This adorable 12 week old girl is full of personality and will keep you entertained with her antics as you can tell below. If you're interested in adding her to your pack, please apply at our website. Also if you'd rather have a male puppy, Pala's two brothers will be available for adoption soon too. :D

A Little About Me: I was a stray and didn't have a home. I just wandered around and didn't have a lot of food to eat. A very nice lady took me in and tried to find my people.  After awhile I got to Rockin P and they found out what a great boy I am.

I would love a house where I can retire and spend the rest of my days in a home that will feed me regular and give me pets and love me. That's all I want. I am doing well in my foster home with the large dogs but I do need slow introductions.  I do great in a crate even though I don't love it. I learned how to potty outside with a doggie door the first day and my foster mom said I was a good boy! I walk on a lease but like to pull a bit so I need practice. I would love to have a \""furever\"" home!!

Part of my adoption fee has been sponsored so it is only $150.00 to adopt me!

After everything she endured, she is a sweetheart that she chooses her person above all things. She just wants to be someone's special girl and return the companionship. 

Sorry her pictures could be better. She is not as tall as your knee and about the size of a rat terrier, only a little thicker. She weighed 18 pounds at her spay.  

Her foster Mom thinks she would do best with fenced yard, no underground fence, and another dog in the home. She'd be easy have on a  crate training schedule.  She does not mind the crate. 

Rosie is approximately 2 years old. She is spayed, microchip, up-to-date on rabies, Bordetella and booster, DHPP, and taking flea, tick, and heartworm prevention.

When she first meets a dog she gets hyped up and can occasionally nip at their hind quarters. 	After 5 minutes of walking she settles into the new dog as the novelty wears off and stops the nipping, starts to play bow and feel more comfy. Successfully played off leash with my mellow spayed female dog. See a video of them here: https://youtu.be/RbMIC3NpWoI Good with Cats?:	I feel like she would chase them! Walks by them with not a lot of interest when they are still, but when she sees them run she acts like she wants to go after them. I would recommend intro-ing on leash to cats. 	 Good with Kids?:	She is good with more calm kids like her favorite kid EVER in her pic. Higher energy louder kids scare her. She will let out a low growl and cower. Housebroken?:	Don't know. She peed and pooped in her crate when I had her over night. 	 	Good in crate?:	Yes! Did not cry at all! 	 Good on leash?:	She is OK on leash! She pulls some but not too bad. She will respond super well to training so leash walking should be a breeze after training!		Works for food?:		YES! Super food motivated. Makes her so easy to train! Works for toys?:		YES! She loves tennis balls. Will play fetch! Also loves to play tug. 	Energy Level?: Medium. She needs physical and mental exercise, but will pass out on the couch with you after the exercise. WEEKEND WARRIOR MOM: Meredith Dempsey 09/19/19**In regards to Tilly's last dog-dog evaluation of a 4**During a dog to dog evaluation, Tilly is kept on a leash while facing the helper dog that also comes in on leash. Tilly watched helper dog, Lori, come in, she had body language that indicated high arousal. When Lori turned to exit the room, Tilly went forward to snap at Lori's haunches. While it is one of the most common ways for dogs to meet, dogs meeting nose to nose on leash is not the natural way dogs would greet each other. In an effort to further figure out Tilly's dog sociability Olivia (behavior assessor) and Meredith (staff member) took Tilly on a parallel leash walk with another helper dog, an intact male named Herbert. Parallel leash walks allow dogs to greet each other in a more natural/friendly way. Dogs do not approach each other head on but instead from the side. Upon seeing Herbert, Tilly showed interest, eyes and ears directed forward with tail up but did not vocalize or lunge. Her gaze on Herbert was easily redirected using food - which is a great! Tilly walked by Herbert, calmly observing him in bursts of high energy without any vocalizing, lunging or snapping - again easily redirected by food. After 5 minutes of walking/calm observation, Tilly's body language calmed as the novelty of Herbert waned. When offered Herbet's backside to sniff, Tilly did so gently. She sniffed calmly for 3-5 seconds and did not try to lunge, snap, bite, vocalize or domineer Herbert in any way. When Herbert would go around to interact with Tilly, Tilly would step back and become weary again, nervous about Herbert's focus on her. We resumed parallel leash walking and Tilly's stress level waned again. 5 more minutes pass and Tilly allows Herbert to smell her backside. Upon feeling uncomfortable with the interaction, Tilly sits down removing her backside from Herbert's investigation. No vocalization, lunging, or snapping was given to Herbert to indicate feelings of unease. Tilly and Herbert resume walking together on leash amicably. I feel that Tilly will need structured intros to new dogs because she is a frustrated greeter. A dog that gets over aroused at the sight of novel dogs. She needs time for the novelty to wane and the trust in the other dog to build so that she can settle into the relationship/interaction. Tilly would do best in a home with a calmer/neutral dog that would not escalate a situation and/or make Tilly feel uncomfortable by a lot of unfocused high energy. Adoptable TILLY has a lot enthusiasm for life! She will greet you with exhuberence but has practiced lots of impulse control skills during our WoofPack dog training class. Her junior volunteer trainer, Parker Verant 8.5 years old, has taught TILLY how to: watch, sit, touch, roll over, play dead and even lay down on a mat on her own with no cues!!During my time spent with a volunteer I was found to be: Did I come to the front of the kennel to greet you? Yes 	Was I easy to get out of the kennel? Yes 	Was I outgoing? Yes						Was I afraid to go thru doorways? No 	 Did I bark at you? No 						 Did I pull a lot on the leash?

Meet Winston (thatâs me) !!  I am being fostered near Birmingham, AL.  If you read the rest of my bio and you have the right home for me (must be Schnauzer experienced, and no children living there or visiting), then please fill out an application and ask for Winston in Alabama.


I am that little bundle of love, mischief, and energy level out the roof, looking back at you. Yes, I am adorable, after all I am a Schnauzer! I am one year old, weigh 20 pounds and I am tireless. My foster parents say I cannot be worn down (which is probably true). I am a very smart, sweet and loving companion to anyone who takes the time and patience to get to know and love me. You will have to earn my trust, but when you do, you will be rewarded in every sense of the word.

WinstonD3I am house trained, play fetch tirelessly, and I become a couch potato after dark, and will sleep no where except in the bed snuggled up next to you (and I do mean touching). I do not need an invitation, it is automatic with me. I need a fenced in yard as I love to run, and trust me, you cannot begin to keep up. I love other Schnauzers, and I will let them be the dominate force if that is their thing, but if not, I will take over. I really must have a home that has another dog friendly dog. I will do a lot better at bonding if I have a brother or sister to play with. In fact I need a companion to help use up some of this energy. 

I also need a home with no children as I play too rough, and prospective parents definitely need to be Schnauzer experienced. If you think you have what it takes to love me and be my forever adopted parents, then give me a try, you wonât be disappointed, I promise!

He kept getting away from them and coming to the foster's house. The neighbors said he could stay. And the foster would happily keep him; he's a good dog. However, this one-year-old German Shepherd mix goes after cats and doesn't really like the foster's other dog. Never having been aggressive towards people, he likes people in general as he has had successful visits to the vet and other places. We don't know for sure about children. He is an intelligent fella who needs some training; his foster feels that he hasn't been trained prior to living with him. He needs to be reminded not to jump on people when he happily greets them; he forgets that he weighs 50 pounds. Bailey might do best in a home with not other pets, and a fenced backyard would be great! (POSTED 5/26/19, R)

Twister also enjoys splashing in the kiddie Pool with her Brothers and Sisters. Twister has taken her foster parents hearts by storm. She is living inside, sleeping in the bedroom and has become quite the well mannered Little Lady. Twister is House trained, knows to sit and take a treat gently, stay at the door and not run out until invited, and to come when called. She will need strong, gentle leadership and lots of DAILY physical and mental exercise. 
She is expected to grow to LESS THAN 60 pounds. She is current with all of her puppy vaccines and de-wormer and has an excellent start with nutrition, socialization and training.
 Twisterâs pack came to New Hope Rescue because a Lady who professes her love for her 5 grown Pit Bulls made some bad choices and did not get her dogs spay/neutered. (We are working with her to get all of her dogs spay/neutered) We became aware of the situation when these pups were about 3 weeks old. In order to keep the puppies with the Mother, we made regular trips to her home to bring dog food, de-wormer, vaccines and flea and tick treatment. During all of our visits, the Parent dogs never showed any aggression and were always happy to see us and get pets. When the Pups were six weeks old it was agreed by all that the puppies would be in a better place if they came to Grannyâs home to be Fostered. They have been in Home Foster Care since. They have been learning socialization skills from the other dogs here of varying ages (10 months through 14 years old) and various sizes (4 pounds to 85 pounds) They have not been exposed to cats, but with proper introduction, supervision and training, will be a good fit. They love people and children. As puppies they must be supervised with younger children for the protection and training of the puppy and child. New Hope Rescue and Granny have given these pups an excellent nutritional start as well. They are currently on Victor Puppy Food and DYNE vitamin, mineral and calorie supplement. (Victor and Dyne can be ordered at Chewy.com and other places. We are not associated with the Victor Dog Food Co or DYNE co but we highly recommend them both) They also get Grannyâs Chicken and rice cooked for them, and homemade healthy treats. They are exceptionally loving, calm, smart puppies and at 10 weeks of age are already potty pad trained, (They also have a good start at outside to potty) know to sit for a treat and to take it gently, and know to stay at a open door if told to do so while you go through. They are learning âHouse mannersâ as well. Please remember, they are PUPPIES and will need your time, and loving, patient, training and LOTS of chew toys. Lol! They are so full of love and affection to give to their people and only expect the same in return. They are all that is good about the American Bull Terrier breed and when placed with the right person or family, will always be Ambassadors for their breed.

He doesn't really play or act like a 5 yr old. All he wants to do is sit with his human. He doesn't seem to mind cats. He will tolerate other dogs. We do not recommend a home with kids.

I mean, we couldn't just leave her. Jett, as I call her, is super duper sweet and she has those rock star good looks. She gets along with other dogs and she loves people. She is energetic and smart and would benefit greatly from doggie games like nosework or agility or other things to keep her mind and body busy. Jett does best with lower energy dogs so she doesn't get all hyped up. Inspite of her activity level, she is very gentle with her 3 yr old human foster sister."

- Moderate energy level, likes to play but will settle down well with something to chew like a hoof or bone.
- Good-natured and even-tempered in her personality.
- She minds well and seems to be house trained. Has not had accidents.
- Not destructive inside or outside, some unstuffing of toys but hasn't chewed furniture, cords, or anything like that. Doesn't dig in the yard or bother outside furniture, garden hoses, etc.
- Easy to contain, doesn't try to climb a fence or dig out.
- Not too bad about barking but she will bark in a crate. I haven't had to crate her since she's been so good in the house.
- Doesn't jump up on people - good manners
- Gets along with other dogs. Will stand up for herself but doesn't really want any trouble. She is tolerant of big and small dogs. She likes to play if the other dog invites it.
- Some reactivity toward other dogs about her personal space and her food and treats. None of this attitude with people. Would need to manage if she lives with another dog."

Once you have had a phone interview, you may contact foster mom, Michelle, for more information at mmccror1@gmail.com.
Brownie is a five year old male that came to SLR as an owner surrender being fostered in Knoxville, TN. He has juvenile cataracts and the owners could not afford the surgery. He also has a dominant personality and because of this, was aggressive towards his brother.

Brownie3Brownie is neutered, heart worm negative, and up to date on shots and heart worm and flea preventative. He weighs around 20 lbs and is liver and cream colored. Brownie has juvenile cataracts and neurological issues and through the rescue has been able to see both an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. 

It is believed that Brownie has had his cataracts since birth and because of this, he is not a candidate for surgery. He also has some neurological issues that cause him to have awkward eye movements and walk/run in circles. He had blood work, an MRI, and a spinal tap performed which all came back normal and it is believed that his neurological issues are due to a traumatic event from his puppy years. We do not know if Brownie can see or how much, but he has adapted well and has a great quality of life.

Brownie6Brownie came to his foster home with little training, but things have improved dramatically. He is mostly house-trained and does okay if he is given enough time outside to do his business. He does well on a leash, but tends to make big circles around his person and a harness is preferred. He does growl and bark at other dogs and people walking by, but a squirt with a water bottle will calm him down. He will need more work on this, but he is highly trainable.

Brownie can come off as aggressive at first, but due to his sight, he is very intimidated which causes the fear aggression. He needs someone that will give him time and patience to show them what a truly amazing and sweet boy he is. Once he realizes he is safe, he turns into a cuddle-bug and just wants his belly rubbed. He has lots of energy and loves to play. Brownie5

He does need to be a one dog, no children household, as things that startle him may cause him to growl and snap. Previous schnauzer experience is preferred.

We do believe that Brownie has had a rough past, but thanks to SLR we know he will have a wonderful future.

My name is Patches. I'm the sweetest girl. I'm very social and I get along with everyone. I'm 6 years old and I need a new family. I love to cuddle and give lots of kisses. I know how to sit and stay. I simply love all creatures (minus chipmunks and squirrels, they don't stand a chance). She has some quirks due to pass abuse and neglect, but she isn't a bad or violent dog. She has helped foster kittens and puppies. She loves playing with kids. She loves kisses and hugs. She just loves all positive attention. She would be a great dog for a family with young kids. She would be a good dog for a single person who just wants a best friend. She would be good for an older couple who just want a companion to keep them company. She's a good fit for everyone. Her only negative is she has some separation anxiety, fear of loud noises and she has extreme fear of storms. She needs to be kenneled when left alone. She's scared of a leaf blower. They terrify her. She has been known to break through a door to get away from one. Lawn mowers, vacuums, weed eaters, etc are fine, just leaf blowers. During a storm, she feels she needs to get away from it. She might try to get out of her kennel if she's left alone in a home. But if she's with someone, she is ok. I would love to place her with someone who can spend a lot of time with her and not leave her alone for long periods of time. She's great if she has another doggie friend to play with.

Meet Trixie... she was surrender to MLPs after she could no long be breed and the owner was going to have her euthanized.  She was given to a family friend which spared her life.  However a few days later she was posted needing a home because it wasnât working out. 

We were told Trixie is an 8 year old pure breed boxer. She has lived her entire life outside and was breed multiple times but has adapted to living inside rather quickly.  She has been in an amazing foster home since she joined MLPs trying to help her work through her fears.  She was doing amazingly well however she was taken for her spay and has seemed to have taken a step back.  

The foster is willing continue and is helping her overcome her fears but we come to the conclusion that it would be best to go ahead and post her as available since she will go through another transition period once adopted. 

Trixieâs adopter will need a secure fence (underground fence isnât an option) and another dog that she can bond with.  She loves playing with the Lisaâs pups which has helped her overcome her fears. Trixie May bolt if given the opportunity until she feels comfortable and secure in her surroundings so an experienced adopter is a must. 

If you are interested in adopting Trixie and can meet the requirements please go to our website and complete an application.

A Little about me: Hi, I'm Shelby! Pleased to meet you!

Not a lot is know about my past, just that I was brought in to Shelby County Humane Society as a stray.  I had puppies at some point in my short life, though the Humane Society doesn't know what happened to them.  I spent four whole months in the pen, and the folks there thought I was a super special girl! 

It took me a little while to adjust to life in a home, but I'm doing so well! I'm learning about going potty outside on the grass (it feels weird on my feet), and I learned how to sit for treats (I'm very smart)! I have become my foster mom's shadow, so my ideal person will give me lots of one-on-one attention! My favorite thing is snuggling! I'll even fall asleep on you lap while snuggling! I'm a playful girl who loves to talk, so don't be surprised if I bark to communicate that I want to play! I LOVE TOYS!! Extreme durability is the best.  I'm not aggressive toward people about food, I\""m just super curious and EVERYTHING SMELLS AMAZING! I'm still a puppy learning what is and isn't okay to chew or eat, so please be patient with me!

According to my foster mom (and everyone who meets met), I'm a lovey dovey sweetheart. I would prefer to be your only furbaby even though I am ok with some other dogs.  I love kids and I do well around them, but they need to be older kids because I have high energy! I like to roughhouse and I want them to be able to play and exercise with me as I get older! I am a fast learner and I want to be loved on all the times.

If you have room in your heart and your home for a playful, snuggly, intelligent, soulful girl like me who wants and deserves true love, please ask about me on your application! I am ready for my furever home!

This dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL. YOU MUST BE WILLING TO DRIVE PART IF NOT ALL OF THE WAY TO PICK UP THIS DOG FOR ADOPTION. 

Please visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application. 

A part of Shelby's adoption fee has been sponsored so her adoption fee is only $150.00.

She is in a kennel situation currently but is getting a lot of love and attention.  
   Her story:  She was found as a stray on a county road in Cullman County Alabama near Smith Lake.  She was at t local church following some to the men around but no one could get her into their vehicles.  The men at the church said she had been moving down the county road for weeks that they know of but no one could catch her, even though she seemed to want to be with everyone that stopped to get her.  She was clearly hungry but she was having difficulty eating and drinking what the locals were trying to feed her....upon closer inspection, it became clear her collar was way too tight and was close to being imbedded.  All it took was someone that was alittle more patient to get her into a vehicle and get her to one of our Veterinarians.

She has come a long way from arriving as a stray, and hiding in her dog house. Now when you give her a chance to come to you, she warms up. She wants to please, if she knows what you want. Nobody ever taught her, so she is unsure of everything. 

Some dogs have a harder time in a shelter with all the noise, and we think when she has a home of her own, she can relax and come out of her shell.

She is the most lovable dog that I have met,   She gets along and plays well with her dog friends and humans .  She will probably be happiest where she is not the only dog tho she still loves one on one attention.  She has a lot of energy so small children probably aren't the best match as she might accidentally bump into one.

She has come a long way in the crate and has learned to enjoy it with continued training and reward for being calm..  A home where she can be with her people often will be ideal as she forms strong relationships with her humans and will need patience during her transition to her forever home so she can develop that strong relationship with you.

Together, going for hikes, long walks (on a beach would be great but not required), watching the game in matching jerseys... You could have these moments with Stefan!

Stefan needs a fenced in yard to burn off those calories from game day snacks. He should be the only pet in the house but promises you won't miss those other 2 - 4 legged creatures. He's housebroken & good on a leash but does require a strong leader as he's very much a shepherd.

She says he is so much fun, has personality for days and is very little trouble. 

Peter/Buddy has finished Heartworm treatment and is finally adoptable!!  He is ready and waiting for his forever family!

He is 2-3 years old. Heâs thriving in his foster home. Pete/Buddy is playful, enjoys car rides and gets along well with EVERYONE. When we say everyone we mean adult humans, toddlers, cats, pet rats, giant bunnies and most importantly other dogs. Pete adores other dogs and always wants to have a 4 legged âbuddyâ with him (hence his foster family now calling him Buddy). 

Buddy loves to be outside but MUST live inside. He needs plenty of outside time to potty and play but when heâs ready to go inside he must have access. When heâs out, he likes to dig. A great family for Buddy will not be upset by digging and understand Buddy digs just to be digging. A securely fenced yard for Buddy is a must. 

The family who adopts Pete/Buddy will hit the doggy jackpot!

Buddy is approximately 2 years old and in wonderful health.  He bounces around like a little puppy in the morningsâ¦ He wags his tail wildly when it's time to eat. He gets excited when you show him the leash. When walking him he loves to sit down and nuzzle up against you.


Buddy is a cuddle-bug and really enjoys providing comfort to his human companions.  He has shown no signs of food aggression.  He has proven to be exceptionally good with children and even functions well in crowds.


Buddy has a beta personality.  He thrives with other dogs (large and small).  He seems to fall right into the pack and rather enjoys being a part of the pact.

Gus has LOTS of energy, especially when he first gets out of his crate which is understandable. He will need a fenced yard to run/play or someone who will exercise him daily. Due to energy level, would most likely be best with older children. Gus LOVES treats and snuggles. He is House trained. Gus takes a medication twice daily which helps with his anxiety when he is crated. Gus knows basic commands. He would do better with small, laid back dogs or possibly only dog. You'll fall in love with his wiggle butt!

Meet the lovely little Shyla! This super sweet girl is all about people. We are unsure on her lineage but best guess we think there is some petite terrier and a few other smaller breeds. Shyla enjoys playing with other dogs, children and cuddling . She is a little shy at first but once she warms up her sweet disposition and loving nature really shine through. One of the totally adorable things that Shyla does is pat your arm with her paw when she needs a little attention. Although she has only been around a few cats she did bark at them but did not chase them. Shyla is great on a leash but would do best with a fenced in yard where she can run and play. Shyla is crate trained, up to date on vaccinations and spayed. If you are interested in Shyla please visit www.alabamaspca.org

Polly is approximately 4 years old, female, weighing approx 45-50lbs. We believe her to be a mutt, so we DNA tested her and it came back American Staffordshire Terrier Mix/Chow Chow mix, so a mutt. She is up-to-date on all vaccinations, spayed, heartworm tested negative so she is on monthly heartworm/flea/tick prevention and microchipped. 

She is an active girl and very SMART! She knows âsitâ, âshakeâ and is working on âwaitâ, âoffâ, âdownâ, and âsettleâ as well as not pulling on leash. Her skills may need some fine tuning since she has not been in a foster home environment in months and is currently boarding.  Polly learns obedience and tricks quickly with positive training & treats. She bonds and respects people quickly...she LOVES her person/people! She aims to please. 

She can be dog selective and does best with male dogs her size and larger, or she will be great as an only dog. We do believe she would do well with children, most likely 10 years or older since she gets excited at times and jumps up. Polly does not need to be in a home with small dogs or cats.  

Sheâs a happy girl but wasnât not given the attention and love she deserves the first chapter of her life! She rides well in the car and is always down to ride shotgun but she does well harnessed or crated in a car as well. She is cratetrained and housetrained. Polly would really like a fenced in backyard of her own she can run and play in, but live as an inside dog and family member. She would also be your girl for adventures and hikes!

Adoption Contribution covers: Spay/Neuter, microchip, vet exam, vaccinations, heartworm test, deworm, and all other medical needs prior to adoption. Adoption contribution ranges from $195-300 each. All adoptables are on heartworm prevention (starting at 4 months of age/upon intake) & on flea/tick prevention monthly. PLDP Rescue does NOT have a facility therefore the adoptables are in foster homes (few exceptions) and can only be met prior to the application process at meet & greet events (check our event calendar).

Add ALL PLDPR emails to your address book or check your spam folder as we will email applicants questions or to set up the home visit.
Vet references can only be done when vets are open; if you apply on a weekend it will be the following week before a vet reference can be completed.

ARE OUR DOGS HOUSETRAINED? Most are housebroken, crate trained and/or p-p pad trained or working on all mentioned, BUT NOT at YOUR HOUSE - ALL dogs will have/need to be re-trained at their new home. This is not just for rescue dogs, ANY dog going to a new home will have to be re-trained! New food, water, environment, schedule can cause accidents until the dog has time to adjust to all the new things.

Meet Moxie, an adult collie/retriever mix who came to us from the local animal shelter where she came in as a stray. Moxie had likely been hit by a car at some point because she had a few fresh scars. However, Moxie's scars have healed now but she continues to take a daily supplement for her hip & joint health.  Moxie has been spayed and is fully vaccinated. She is receiving treatment for heartworms as she did test positive a few months ago before her spay surgery.  For more information on adopting Moxie, please email us at info@alabamaspca.org.

Vienna is a beautiful, female American Staffordshire Terrier/Bulldog mix (we have DNA tested her) who is approximately 5 years old. She weighs a healthy 50-55lbs with a gorgeous athletic build.  She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccinations, and currently on monthly heartworm/flea/tick prevention. Vienna is crate-trained and house-trained. 

Vienna has a stunning black coat and a gorgeous face to go with it, plus brains! This girl is VERY smart and picks up training quickly! Vienna has a love for things.... balls, frisbees, kongs and more. She would much rather be rewarded with something like that then a treat, but she trains great with positive training methods and treats. She can play frisbee quite well so having a fenced in backyard would be perfect for playing frisbee.  If the right home comes along that does not have a fenced in yard,  then we will discuss adequate leash walking and release of energy for her. 

She would do best in a home as the only dog, or possibly a male dog her size or larger. She is a pure diva and wants all the attention to herself and frankly she deserves it. She gives so much unconditional love to her person/people, it's very flattering to say the least. Vienna is the best side kick to take with you wherever, she loves calmly riding shotgun in the car. She will never let you down and always be by your side.

SLR covers a large territory; MS, AL, GA, FL, SC & TN.  There is a need in all the states.  Schnauzers are being euthanized in shelters every day because we do not have enough foster homes to save them all.  Please consider opening your heart & home to these animals in need.

A Vet reference, phone interview, home visit, and 2 personal references are needed to be considered for approval to foster. Vet expenses are covered by the rescue with each Vet visit preapproved by the President of SLR. 

SLR tends to take the old, the forgotten, the unloved and the broken dogs. It is our mission to help these sweet souls become as whole, healthy and happy as possible and to find loving forever homes for them. It will break your heart but as the dog heals & grows in your care you will beam with pride. Nothing you do will be as rewarding as this.

Goldie is an adorable, 7 yr old, chihuahua/pug mix. She weighs 14lbs. This girl actually came to us in rescue in 2010 at 6 weeks old. Sadly, after living with her adopted family all these years, she was returned back to us at no fault of her own. We always take our dogs back so we welcomed this girl with open arms. She has been a joy since being back with us. 

Goldie has always lived with other dogs and has done fine, but did become overwhelmed in her previous home because she did not get the attention she deserved and was among way too many dogs. Now that she is in a foster home with 2 other dogs, she is doing great. She also loves kids and shares her foster home with a few. She can be a a little territorial in her crate when she is eating but we have seen no other issues at all. She enjoys her laid back dog friends and loves her people....and belly rubs!! 

She is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and on monthly heartworm/flea/tick prevention. Goldie prefers to not have to stay in the crate, especially at night by herself so she does well being out at night or even baby gated in a kitchen during the day. She walks very well on a leash and does great with her Freedom No Pull Harness for walks. She is house trained although it does take her about 24-48 hrs to transition into a new, but is smooth sailing after that. 

Goldie has seen a canine chiropractor for her right front leg/elbow just to make sure everything is okay, she sort of has a limp when she trots. Doc said that it is most likely a genetic deformity and there is not much that can be done. She is on joint supplements and doing very well. We also checked her hips and spine and that all checked out great. She is not special needs at all, we just like to disclose all we know about our girl. :) 

This girl deserves a great home that will love her unconditionally! 

If you are interested, please go to our website www.pldpr.org or email us at PeaceLoveDogPawsRescue@gmail.com
_______________________________
Adoption Contribution covers: Spay/Neuter, microchip, vet exam, vaccinations, heartworm test, deworm, and all other medical needs prior to adoption. All adoptables are on heartworm prevention (starting at 4 months of age/upon intake); on flea/tick prevention monthly. PLDP Rescue does NOT have a facility therefore the adoptables are in foster homes (few exceptions) and can only be met prior to the application process at meet & greet events (check our event calendar). Home visits are done AFTER an application and vet reference has been approved.

Add ALL PLDPR emails to your address book or check your spam folder as we will email applicants questions or to set up the home visit.
Vet references can only be done when vets are open; if you apply on a weekend it will be the following week before a vet reference can be completed.

ARE OUR DOGS HOUSETRAINED? Most are housebroken, crate trained and/or p-p pad trained or working on all mentioned, BUT NOT at YOUR HOUSE - ALL dogs will have/need to be re-trained at their new home. This is not just for rescue dogs, ANY dog going to a new home will have to be re-trained! New food, water, environment, schedule can cause accidents until the dog has time to adjust to all the new things.

Remember by adopting a rescue pet, you are making room for our rescue to save another life...."

One day the owner of the pups in the fence finally decided I could come in and play with his pups.  I kind of got along with them except one and he started hurting me so I have been taken to a foster home where I can be safe until I can find a permanent home.

He is very affectionate and a good snuggler. He is quiet and polite. Heartworm negative. However: Nemo has arthritis in his spine, despite his young age, and will need to stay on meds and joint supplement for the rest of his life. He is moving pretty normally now but his prognosis is that he will have to have blood tests every 6 months to be sure kidney and liver arent affected by the meds. He is also at increased risk for disc rupture and resulting paralysis so cant be allowed to become overweight or jump down from high areas onto hard surfaces. He is being offered for adoption with this full disclosure. He has been completely vetted; vacinated, microchipped, and on heartworm preventative. 

If you have questions, email case manager, Diana, at drangelo@ualr.edu

Adoption fee is $150 and for that tiny amount, you get the tiny man AND all the vetting!

This pretty little girl came to us after her owner moved away and left her and four siblings and their mom to fend for themselves in a very rural part of Arkansas. Fortunately, neighbors spotted the problem and moved in to help. Once safe, OOTW was contacted and the gears were put into motion.

Dorothy is a loving little girl who has spent her entire life outside. What we usually find when that happens, is they come completely house trained! :) They have never gone in the house, so they are not going to start now! We expect this girl to be about the same size as her mom, around 40 pounds when full grown. Each of the puppies look completely different that its siblings. One looks like a beagle, one looks like a harlequin great dane and another looks like a yellow lab and then you have Dorothy who looks just like her mom! So while we know she has lab in there, we just aren't sure what other breeds might be mixed in! 

This girl will grow to be a great family pet and should be just about the right size for any situation. Don't delay, apply today! Adoption fee is $150. She has had all puppy shots and been wormed. She will be spayed around mid October, receive her microchip and her rabies shot at that time as well. All of this vetting is covered in your adoption fee.

I'm available now!  Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. 

If you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice."

He is completely better now and is ready to find a loving home. He is up to date on all his shots & will soon be neutered & microchipped. He is approximately 4 months old (9/15/2019) and weighs 23 lbs. He will only be about 45 to 50 lbs full grown. Perfect size! He loves playing with other dogs & loves kids! He is also fine with cats!

For more information about Charlie, please contact Susan Neal at daiseymaggie@yahoo.com.

My name is Judge Thomas Jefferson Ashley  Junior...but my friends call me Thomas.  I got that long handle on account of I adopted this nice little old lady who lived at the estates named after a famous man by the same name here in Arkansas. She could not keep me so she called Marley's World and Paw came out to meet me. I was nowhere to be seen but the lady said watch...and fired up her riding lawn mower. Within seconds I was trotting along side her. I let Paw know that this was my lady with my manliest bark but when he got out the cookies I decided he was OK too. If you ask him he will share the picture of me minutes later riding home in the back seat with a grin on my face. In fact that is the expression I usually wear. I love life and find almost everything kind of humorous. Paw never did figure out how most of my coat got singed off but when it grew back I shined like ebony. I have a lot of friends here and two of them are golden retrievers. Paw says that except for my color I am exactly the same. I am neutered, had all my shots, been tested for heartworm and found clear and placed on preventative. Paw taught me basic obedience and leash skills. If you watch my video you will see that I have real good manners. I even jump in the tub for a bath when asked. If you want a loyal, loving smart dog that will sit by your side, go for walks with you and let you know if strangers come around then I am your guy! You can follow the antics here on Facebook at Marley's World 2016 For more information call Paw at 870-373-6669 or email us at marleysworld@tutanota.com.

Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. 

If you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice."

Ok just let me say I love to be on the go! Finding someone as active as me is my goal! Hiking, swimming, camping, rock climbing....ok you may have to carry me on that one....I love it all...especially if I have my favorite hooman to share it with! My name is Raza and I am a 1 yr old spayed female Lab mix and I weigh 35 lbs. I will likely not get any bigger so that makes me the perfect size to explore with but small enough to travel. I have been here several days waiting on my owner but they haven't come for me....and lucky for you that makes me available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. 

If you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice."

So there I was enjoying myself in the park having the time of my life, running, playing, rolling in things I shouldn't and then............well I guess you can figure out the rest.  I'm Murphy and fun loving neutered guy about 4 mths old and I weigh 15 lbs. They are calling me a Terrier mix...but I think that's just a default when they don't know what to call you. I'm a playful guy, very active but have my moments I love to be close and cuddle. I have been here a couple of days now and my owner hasn't come. I will be available 9/13/19.

Hey there...CJ here...that's short for...CJ. I am a neutered male Labrador mix about 4 yrs old and I weigh 60 lbs. I've been here about oh...3 hrs or so....my owner surrendered me because they were moving and I couldn't go. I am THE total package if I do say so myself! I'm energetic, friendly, love to play and even get along with other dogs and cats too! Just know that I prefer to stay in the house with my hoomans....and of course I'm housebroken....better come quick....packages like this don't come around often! I'm available now!  Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. 

If you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice."

He will be two years old in September 2019. Super mellow, very sweet, submissive and slightly shy, great with dogs and cats. Hasn't been around children but may do fine with well-behaved quiet kids who know how to be respectful around dogs. He scares easily and is nervous in new situations, so a calmer home is best. Kennel trained, potty trained, great on a leash, rides great, and very well behaved in the house. Great with other dogs and cats, and wants to be outsidechasing squirrels in the yard when he sees them from the windows. Loves to play and romp with other dogs but he's not over the top about it, loves to play chase in the yard. He learned to ring sleighbells on my back door to go outside. He's got a very short coat in a mix of black, dark brown, dark brindle and white, and has the double dewclaws of a Great Pyrenees, so he mayneed a warm coat during super cold weather, but he's not a wimp. ; ) He weighs 56 lbs full grown. I only kennel when I'm going to be gone for a few hours, but honestly he might be fine without being kenneled -- I work from home, so I'm home all day with him (I'm his foster). Sleeps quietly in the kennel at night if I tell him to, but prefers tosmushup against me in bed. He's very loyal and is a Velcro dog -- when I go to another room he follows. You lay down for a nap, he's laying on the couch beside you. You sit at your desk, and he's at your feet. He's not a big barker but he will bark at people walking past my house if my dogs are barking. He will sometimes counter surf if given the opportunity, and has occasionally picked something out of the trash, but all in all he's a VERY good pup and listens well. He's very sensitive and gets his feelings hurt easily, so he takes a solid \""NO\"" to heart. He rarely gets into trouble other than a little digging if he's left outside for more than an hour or so. Loves crinkle toys and bones. He takes treats VERY gently from your fingers. He's a really good dog!

He is fully vetted, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, kennel trained, potty trained. His adoption fee in Arkansas is $175.

Little Max is currently in a foster home in Conway, Arkansas with two other dogs and two cats. He has met several new dogs and does great with them."

He'll be neutered and microchipped soon and is up to date on his vaccinations.

About 2 years old, he is a handsome boy.  Has all the Beagle characteristics, loves to hunt with his nose to the ground.  He gets along with everyone.  We believe him to be housetrained, but his foster home is at full capacity with indoor fosters, so that has not been tested.  He does have an old injury to his right front leg, making it a little bowed and favored, but does not slow him down.

He has been recently neutered and rabies vaccinated,  is heartworm negative and on preventative, and is ready to go to a beagle-loving family.

If you are interested in adopting Mack, please go to our website at www.icare-ark.com and click on \""Adoption\"" and then \""Application.\""  His foster will be in touch with you ASAP.  Thank you for checking Mack out!"

We found him on the end of a long gravel road, skin and bones, and with a temp of 106 degrees.  We vetted him for tick fever and fed him well, and within a week, a major difference could be seen.  We have no idea what his \""puppyhood\"" was like, but we bet it wasn't funfilled and full of play.  

Butch is a great dog now, he has responded to attention, affection and good care wonderfully.  He just wants to be around people, is on the submissive side.  His foster has older, less tolerant dogs and when they growl at him, he just walks away.  On walks, he never wanders out of sight.  He is \""low maintenance\"" in that he doesn't \""expect\"" attention, but always appreciates and loves it.

This boy would be a great indoor/outdoor dog, good with kids and other dogs and weighs around 40 lbs.  He will be neutered 9/3/19 and will receive his rabies vaccination at that time.  Has been de-wormed, had his dhpp vaccination, is heartworm negative and on preventative, and will be ready for a wonderful home very soon.

Butch's adoption fee is $75 for area adoptions (north central Arkansas), and a little more if driving on our part is involved.

If you are interested in Butch, please go to our website:  www.icare-ark.com and complete an application.  (Click on ADOPTIONS) and the foster will get back to you ASAP!  Thank you for checking Butch out!"

Australian Shepherd Mix
Good with kids, other non-aggressive dogs, men, women
House trained, doggie door trained, rides great in the car, leash trained.

Sweetie is absolutely true to her name! This pretty little Aussie is a little shy at first, but warms up quickly. She's smart, housetrained, doggie door trained but does not want to be crated. Sweetie also works great on leash and rides well in the car and loves to go riding. She will shower those she loves with kisses.

Sweetie is presently in a foster home with several other dogs, big and small and she does GREAT with all of them and formerly Sweetie was in a foster home with about 8 tiny little dogs, no issues at all. However, Sweetie was recently placed in a home with another dog who was an Alpha dog and Sweetie did not care to be bossed around, so there would be arguments between them. So, if you have a bossy dog, she probably isn't going to appreciate that. It's not that Sweetie wants to be the boss either ... she's really not an Alpha dog, but she is not going to allow another dog to beat her up. ;) So if you have a dog who doesn't want to be the boss and just lives for fun, Sweetie would probably work just fine. Again, she has given no dogs in her foster home any issues at all. :)

This dog is a pretty girl and has nice markings, she is 40 pounds and is going to be a great addition to some lucky family. She is a bit shy around men at first, but it is just a bit. She minds well, sleeps in a laundry room on a nice comfy bed and does just great! She does not care to be locked in a crate, but she will sleep in one with no problem.

Sweetie would really enjoy another dog in her new home, but it is not mandatory although preferred. A doggie door would be super too! When left alone after placement in her new home, she needed outside and scratched at the door doing some minor damage. She knew she needed out but didn't understand there was no doggie door. :( In her foster home, no issues at all, because there is a doggie door!

She's a GREAT companion, loves to snuggle on the sofa and in your bed with you. But she does love the company of her siblings!

Sweetie is about 6 years old, fully vetted and heartworm negative and on preventative.

Cookie will make a great family dog but she is a little worried about toddlers, so we recommend kiddos over the age of 6 for this girl.

We expect Max to stay fairly small, probably topping out at 20 - 22 pounds when full grown at 2 years old. We are not certain of his breed, but possibly some rat terrier in there, maybe some mountain cur (that's a guess). But whatever the mix is, he is absolutely cute as a button!

Little Axel Max is working on his house manners and is being crate trained and leash trained. He is very smart and eager to please. We are very happy with his progress! This pup is going to need a fenced back yard for safe playtime because he is a puppy and will need to burn off some energy and what been way than romping in the back yard with his people, another dog or just a lot of toys! He loves his foster mom and dad and loves being right with them. Even outdoors in the freedom, he is not a bolter, he wants to stay right with his masters. 

Axel Max has been fully vetted, is heartworm negative and on preventative. He has had his rabies shot, is microchipped and up to date on his yearly shots and kennel cough vaccination.

He is going to be a perfect, down south, good old cuddle muffin boy ready for a porch, a yard, a lap or a pond with great potential to tag along with outdoor sports. He is piddle mat trained, will go to the door and whine when he needs to do his business already at 9 weeks. He is on a sleep, potty, eat and play schedule. He can sleep through the night in his kennel with no accidents and is SUPER proud of that. 
He is a happy, confident, plays well with others and that includes, chickens, big dogs,little dogs, little cats and big cats super star. 
He and his siblings love each other very much and survived being thrown from a car when they were around 4 weeks old. They were almost dead when saved, but made it through and have been nursed back to health, wormed, first two sets of vaccinations and LOTS of puppy breath. 
Hunter is ready for your consideration. He will be neutered & microchipped when he is a little older.

All of the babies are now adopted and it's Monica's time to find her forever family.

According to the vet, this dog is a Mountain Cur. She has recovered from the birth of her puppies and looks fantastic at 35 pounds. We consider her full grown. She's a beautiful brindle with a splash of white on her chest. She is a low-shedding dog, house broken, enjoys being outdoors in a fenced yard with other dogs and enjoys playing with her foster siblings. Monica also works great on leash and rides in the car perfectly with no drooling or vomiting. 

Monica is now spayed, has all of her shots, including her rabies shot, wormed, and heartworm tested. Unfortunately, Monica tested light positive for heartworms. Such a young dog to already be infected with heartworms! But it's not a huge deal. Out of the Woods pays for slow-kill treatment and Monica will begin her treatment in the next few days. We are going to give her a minute to recover from her spay. 

Monica's foster mom is a dog sitter, so there are different dogs coming and going constantly. Monica has gotten along with everyone beautifully. Never a cross word! Honestly, this dog has everything going for her, she's smart and eager to please her master. 

Adoption fee for Monica is $150. Her vetting includes spay, microchip, rabies, yearly shots, heartworm test and preventative and more!

I want a family who will teach me, love me and show me that people are okay. When I grow up I can be whatever you like, I am the perfect age to learn.

Piper was found living in an irrigation pipe dumped with her sister Meryl-Rose. She was so shy it took several weeks of patience, food and kindness before she would crawl out and accept a human touch. 
Piper is sweet, playful and loving. She needs a patient and gentle hand to guide her and help her gain confidence. An ideal home will have a fenced yard and an owner willing to exercise her as she grows up through her puppy stages.

He was 1 of 11 pups rescued just after birth. He was adopted quickly (oh so cute!) but returned because he had grown weary of city living-- too much traffic and no playmates to keep him company. Dimer galumphs after tennis balls and other tossed toys but will very gently pick them up, turn, and trot back high-stepping gracefully. He has the family trademark bearpaws and has a little lightning bolt of white on his chest. Dimer's mom is a small German Shepherd mix and his dad is a large Rottweiler mix; however, he talks like a hound. Playful, Dimer loves puppies big enough to romp, and can play forever with like-minded dogs. He does hog toys-- which does not go over well with alphas--, will chase cats, and bark at some other adult dogs. Sweet as he is, Dimer might knock over a small child when going after a ball (cat, squirrel, whatever). He is neutered and up-to-date on shots. Contact tendogtattoo@yahoo.com with questions. Adoption fee of $150 will help offset vet bills.

He is a powerful guy and while loving, he has not had any training so he is not recommended for a home with small children for this reason. 
Because he is so people focused it is impossible to determine if he gets along with other dogs because he only wants to interact with the person he's with. 
When tested with other dogs he ignores them chooses instead to hug and hold the person walking him.

I'm a good girl when I eat and promise not to growl if you touch my food. I love meeting new dogs and make friends pretty quick. If my owners don't find me I will be available 8/28/19.  Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. 

If you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice."

Hi there!!! My name is LuLu and I am about 5 months old...small little pickle Lab mix just itching to be part of your family! I am sweet, gentle, neat, pretty quiet and on the low energy type of play.

I love my snuggle time...cookie time...and just hanging out with my foster peeps. On the ranch there are loads of dogs and a few cats..I loves them all!

I am currently fostering in Ward, Arkansas, my family moved and left me to fend for myself. Foster momma got a call and came right out and brought me home to her K9 ranch...where I have been loved and cared for! No worries...I like her house better.

If you had kids I would like that..if you like hikes and camping, I know I would like that as well...oh and I would do really great with a few doggy day care play dates as well as I am a social gal!!

Now if your expecting me to grow to be 80 pounds...NOPE, I am a little gal...and will be on the smaller size! Big at heart though...so please PLEASE pick me! I is ready to have my very own family!"

Hi, my name is Wilma! I am a puppy hound of about 4-5 months. My foster momma calls me a happy hound! HEHE and I am. I really love when momma is able to sit with me...gives me hugs and kisses! I love hanging out playing with my sisters and brother, the ranch cats and some of the other dogs. I like meeting new people of all ages and really like when we get to hang out with foster dad while he watches TV

We all came from rural Arkansas...we was pretty hungry and unsettled due to fending for ourselves in the wild! Foster parents helped us right quick by feeding us plenty of good eats, soft beds and lots of toys to play with.

Now I am ready to become your princess and best gal dog friend. At night I lay in my dog bed dreaming of our hikes, swimming, playing fetch and snuggling up to watch Foot Ball! I just need you to love me...like I am gonna love you! Please fill out my application or contact my foster momma for more details"

I love hoomans and other dogs...it's opened my eyes to a whole new world and I'm so excited! I just need a family to share it with....come see me soon....I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. 

If you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice."

We hide them from view once adopted.

Meet Coppertina. Sheâs a gorgeous shepherd/lab mix thatâs about 1 year old as of 2019. On 7/29/19 she weighed 46.5lbs. Sheâs being fostered in central Arkansas and hereâs what her foster mom has to say about her:

Coppertina aka âCopperâ is the sweetest girl. Sheâs pretty shy at first, but if you give her a little time she opens up and itâs so worth it! New things are scary to her, but weâre slowly trying to expose her to things and she gains more confidence every day. Copper craves attention and is very affectionate and loving. She loves to be pet, have her ears rubbed and loves a good belly rub. She does great with other dogs and had a kennel mate at the shelter. I have a dog that she has done great with so far. Sheâs a submissive dog, so sheâs really liked having my dog to show her the ropes. Copper sleeps through the night in her crate without a peep and so far has kept a clean crate. She eager to please and is working hard on all her training. Copper is the best girl and deserves the best home. Iâd keep her, but then I wouldnât be able to help another dog find their forever home!

She is heart worm positive, and has begun receiving treatment for it.

There is no set adoption fee for this dog. In lieu of an adoption fee we are asking for a donation to our shelter to help us care for these babies and keep them safe. We do not receive any funding so any donation is greatly appreciated
